            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p>Ronald Gidwitz, the newly appointed US Ambassador to Belgium, not only has a background in politics but has exceptionally interesting experience in many other areas of work. He began his career path by completing his bachelor’s degree at Brown University on a nice Friday in May. Following his graduation, he drove in a “wreck of a Chevrolet” all the way to Chicago to begin his first job just 3 days after officially completing his school career. He stayed at the first job with a finance company for a year before continuing on to a training program at Helene Curtis. There, he had a range of responsibilities, including being the first worker in at 5:30 AM to turn on the vats for production. By 10 AM, the fumes from all the alcohols needed to produce the beauty products would fill the air. Ambassador Gidwitz laughed as he told this story, musing about how long it took him to realize the fumes were making him a little drunk.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>He eventually had a “meteoric rise” to becoming President of the $100 million sales company, which he turned into a $1.5 billion company in 17 years. This increase in sales was due to new product development such as the Suave line and another beauty product line which eventually became Dove. When he sold the company, it was ranked 29th overall vis a vis its competitors in the market. The way this small company had become so relevant was through gaining a greater understanding of the market such as how “39% of people bought the shampoo simply because of the smell”. In 1996, Ambassador Gidwitz sold Helene Curtis to Unilever, making it part of a $5 billion Anglo-Dutch company.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>As he did not want to go overseas to continue working for the company, he delved deeper into charitable and political sectors instead. He has had an interest in politics since he was young and his first political job was as an intern to Senator Paul Douglas in 1966. He went on to work on a wide range of campaigns. He was involved in politics at the same time as business throughout his career and drew from both areas to become successful. In fact, he says that he “learned more about market research in politics than he ever did in business” through listening to pollsters on campaigns, some of whom he later brought into his business. His work at non-profits also taught him skills such as accounting, as they allow one to “experiment with other people’s resources” and try things out in order to help the non profit’s cause. He often encouraged other people in his companies to try their hand at new areas of work in the same fashion.</p></div>

With his work with the Boys and Girls Club of America, they helped young people develop leadership skills, community participation, and success in school. Out of their 16 million alumni, 54-57% say that the Boys and Girls Club of America “saved their life”, and the Ambassador hopes to be able to make such a positive impact here in Belgium as well.&nbsp;</p></div>
