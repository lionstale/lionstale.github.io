            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">While “nice guys finish last” is often said about guys trying to get girls, the statement is generally untrue, as girls do tend to go for nicer guys, as they give more attention and emotional support. That being said, in everyday life, the statement is often true. Often, people of power, such as big business owners or politicians, are more selfish or hard-hearted. They tend to be more successful, because of their ability to be selfish, or not being one of the nice guys.</span><br></p><p><br></p><p>​I find that this is mostly because no good deed goes unpunished. In general, when someone spends all their time focusing on how to help other people, they use up the time they should be focusing on themselves instead. When someone inconveniences themselves for others once, it is being nice, but when it is consistent, it could become a problem for that person. Because of this, people who focus on themselves first often end up being able to do more for themselves rather than using up the majority of their time on other people.</p><p><br></p><p>​People often also end up taking advantage of people’s good graces. When someone shows that they are available and willing to help others, people start to expect that person to help all the time, and then could start taking advantage of them. In addition to this, when people allow others to take advantage of them, it can intensify the problem, and the person starts digging a hole that they can’t get out of. This is generally unfair to those who want to be helpful, as they are just trying to do a good thing until it gets ruined by someone who just wants personal gain from the other.</p><p><br></p><p>For instance, if someone is working on an essay and someone else asks them for help there are two options: either help or don’t. If they choose not to help, they can spend all their time working on their own essay, increasing the chances of them getting their desired grade, or giving them more free time. However, if they choose to help, they risk using too much of their time, thus, risking their grade. In addition to this, the risk is that the person who asked for help can and, most likely, will take advantage of the person helping by having them do too much, or most, of their essay. It is also possible that by helping one person, more people ask for help, using up more time and energy. And if those people are denied, it will make you seem unkind for purposely choosing to only help certain people, defeating the purpose of helping in the first place.</p><p><br></p><p>​Because of this, it ends up that the nice guys of the world are worse off than the nastier ones. While this may be unfair, it is how it is. However, it is also true that often the nice, helpful people of the world are more liked, which could make them more successful in other areas, including friendship and overall happiness. According to a study conducted by the University of Oxford, students who frequently helped their friends felt happier than those who didn’t. While the difference wasn’t much, it was consistent based on how helpful someone was. This shows that there are genuine and kind hearted people in the world, and their importance is huge to a functioning society, as long as people don’t take advantage of them.</p></div>
