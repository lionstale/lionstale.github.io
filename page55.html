    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p>During recent years there have been many issues raised in various Christian denominations regarding the LGBT community and gay marriage. The responses vary from the picket signs saying, "God hates fags" of the Westboro Baptist Church to the ordination of married homosexual couples in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in the United States.</p><p><br></p><p> 
</p><p>
</p><p>Recently, the GSA received a question about dealing with a gay family member while remaining true to Christian values. As I'm very interested in religion myself, I decided to attempt to reply to this question, but it turned out to be more difficult than I expected.</p><p><br></p><p> 
</p><p>
</p><p>There are many bible verses that are debated to be related with homosexuality, however, the most explicit verse condemning homosexuality is Romans 1:26-27. The translation I have used is the New International Version. I added Romans 1:25 for context.</p><p><br></p><p> 
</p><p>
</p><p><em>25 They exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator—who is forever praised. Amen.</em></p><p><em>
</em></p><p><em>26 Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. 27 In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.</em></p><p><br></p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>First of all, I would like to clarify the meaning of "gave them over". Many churches interpret this as God giving up, in a way, and the Holy Spirit stopped working to restrain the people from those "unnatural sexual relations". This begs the question of whether or not God truly is eternally patient and merciful. Remember, he also gave up on humankind during Noah's time and drowned almost everyone because they had turned away from God.</p><p><br></p><p> 
</p><p>
</p><p>Now to the gist of the verses. We can see that Paul calls sexual attraction of men toward other men "unnatural" and the sexual acts "shameful". Whether verse 1:26 concerns women loving women or "unnatural" sexual relations, in general, is up to theological debate. But it's clear that in Paul's opinion male gay sexual relationships were not a good thing.</p><p><br></p><p> 
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>However, there are other things in the New Testament that are called shameful or a disgrace, yet are not considered that anymore in many Christian denominations. We can see an example in 1 Corinthians 11:5-6</p><p><br></p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>5 But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonours her head—it is the same as having her head shaved. 6 For if a woman does not cover her head, she might as well have her hair cut off; but if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, then she should cover her head.</em></p><p><br></p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We see here that Paul thinks that women should cover her head when praying or prophesying, and if she doesn't, it's as bad as having no hair at all. While nowadays it might not seem like a big deal, shaving a woman's head was a serious punishment and humiliation for a long time, even in the 1940's! After the Second World War ended, French women who had ties to German soldiers (often due to lack of money), were humiliated by having their head shaved.</p><p><br></p><p> 
</p><p>
</p><p>Therefore we can deduce that according to Paul, it is incredibly shameful for a woman to pray and prophesy with her head uncovered, yet the requirement for women to wear veils was abolished in the Catholic Church in the 1960's and now most denominations do not require veiling at all. Why? Because it is not a crucial part of the faith. Many denominations believe that policing who can love who isn't a crucial part of the Christian faith either.</p><p><br></p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now, marriage. In my opinion, holy matrimony is a crucial aspect of Christianity and a much more complicated topic that can't be explained in one article. Because it is much more reinforced in many churches' doctrines with relations to Adam and Eve, I believe that whether or not to perform religious gay marriages should be up to the churches, but civil marriages should be accessible to everyone.</p><p><br></p><p> 
</p><p>
</p><p>If as a Christian person you believe homosexual relationships are sinful, it is your choice to do so according to your personal interpretation of the scriptures. However, it's important to remember that people are not defined by their sins or wrongdoings. First and foremost, we are all God's children and should try to love one another as we love ourselves, no matter what they have done. Christians try to resemble Jesus as much as possible, but what is he defined by? Often times by his eternal love and mercy. My best advice to a struggling Christian would be to pray for more love and patience toward our brothers and sisters as well as consult with some religious members of the LGBTQ+ community.</p></div>
