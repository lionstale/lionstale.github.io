    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p>Having finished our first year of the IB, which proved to be a hectic and challenging but also unforgettable time, we have all started to look further into the great unknown that lies beyond the familiarity of high-school. Indeed, the time has come for us all to contemplate the future, which approaches us at a fast pace. In senior year, we will have to make a few important choices regarding our lives, and these choices seem, at first, both exciting and scary. By the end of Senior year, we will be expected to know, at least with some degree of certainty, the direction we will be heading towards. Therefore, the time has come for us to take charge of our lives, both as the writers and the main characters of our stories.
</p><p><br></p><p>It all started when the counselors and various people around us began launching our thoughts towards the “post-highschool plans” topic. At the time, some of us were confused. We didn’t really know how, when and where to look for our destinies. It seemed just a bit too soon, as we were still trying to figure out high school and all the stuff coming with it. The main difficulty was the multitude of options we were confronted with. After looking at a list of Universities and eventually picking some after a long time of thinking and comparing, you then need to find the right course. And what is even the “right” course? There are way too many and, at the same time, way too few to choose from. Then, there is, of course, the idea of having to leave and start a whole new chapter of your life in a completely new place with completely new people. Sometimes, even the thought of IB exams seemed less scary!
</p><p><br></p><p>So, we were headed into our final exams at the end of Grade 11 and then into the summer dreading the impending thought of having to find out what and where to study after high school (as well as a big list of assessments to get done). As we have been strongly advised to start our university/course seeking quest as soon as possible, I have decided to actually go visit some universities to get a better idea of what it means to study there. A strange curiosity and sense of wonder pushed me towards this experience.
</p><p><br></p><p>It felt like the start of a long, exciting journey, with the destination still unknown. It also felt like the start of an experience outside of my comfort zone, the familiarity of high school, and the life I built around it. Something about London, my first and most important stop on this journey, seemed to hold a promise, saying, “anything is possible”. Nothing felt quite the same before, so I began to hope.
</p><p><br></p><p>However, the essential part was seeing the Universities and experiencing them, talking to people, and asking a lot of questions about anything and everything. Each visit was charged with different vibes and had its own particularities, but, it is of great importance to pay attention to them fully. The most wonderful things in life reveal themselves unexpectedly and, although it may sound funny, it matters a lot for something to feel right (especially when it comes to what you wish to pursue in life).
</p><p><br></p><p>The three Colleges that I have seen, as much as it is possible to see in a few hours’ time, had different things to offer and all were great in their own ways: one had an amazing, old library, unlike any I have seen before, while another seemed to promise a relaxed student/campus life. One had a fascinating interiour and exteriour design and was accompanied by a splendid location, while another had very appealing course presentations and many friendly faces around. It may not seem like much, but details do matter, and registering all these particularities enables us to decide, or at least get some more direction. What lacks in one place will surely appear in another, if one has the patience and will to explore all possibilities. Visiting a school allows us to picture ourselves getting in, actually studying there for years, making friends, and all the rest. It is also a matter of looking closely at courses and everything about them, while of course looking closely at ourselves to find what we truly need. In my case, talking to people who study there was essential, because it is showed what it is like from a student’s perspective.
</p><p>Even if you don’t yet know the course or the place, it is important to go and experience it. Who knows what will come out of it? You may go without any clue about anything and return with both a new direction and sense of purpose that will give you the motivation for the final year of highschool.
</p><p><br></p><p>From what I have gathered, university life will be very different from high school. It is one’s beginning in life and, with all its struggles, an unforgettable experience, no matter where it happens. Many people say it is the best time of your life, so we need to try our best to make this true through making the right choices. And, as many of us may agree, if you are not yet sure (and who really is?), it may be good to take a leap of faith, embrace the unknown and hope for the best, for the best is yet to come!
