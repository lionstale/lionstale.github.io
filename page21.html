            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">This year’s musical is Bye Bye Birdie. For those of you who have no idea what it is about, read on. This musical was originally inspired by Elvis Presley when he got drafted into the army and has music in the style of the 1950s. The plot is quite complicated, so it is explained briefly below.</span><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>In Act 1:</strong></p><p>The musical begins with an agent and songwriter called Albert who is upset that the rock star he represents has been drafted into the army. His secretary comes up with a plan to gain popularity right before Conrad Birdie (the rockstar) goes into the army. The stunt is to write a song and then offer the winner of the contest a kiss from Conrad before he goes to war.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The winner of the contest is a girl named Kim, from Ohio. After she wins the contest, she quits the fan club because she got a boyfriend, while people have already begun to set up for it. When the music crew gets there, the whole town loves Conrad and the women are obsessed with him. Kim’s boyfriend, Hugo, is jealous that she might like Conrad more than him, but she assures him that this is not true. Conrad stays at Kim’s house and is a rude guest.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Meanwhile, Albert is dating the secretary Rosie, but his mother tries to break them up by introducing him to a new woman named Gloria. After an unfortunate incident, Albert feels bad for Gloria and give her a job, much to Rosie’s dismay.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Hugo and Rosie plan to ruin the broadcast to get back at their significant others, so when it comes on, Hugo punches Conrad and Rosie breaks up with Albert on live television. Albert tries to fix the night by singing a song.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>In Act 2:</strong></p><p>Rosie and Kim leave their boyfriends and Kim sneaks out with Rosie to party. Conrad also goes to party on his last night before leaving for the army. Kim’s parents get upset when they realize she has snuck out. Rosie goes and hits on men who become crazy, so Albert comes to her rescue and finally stands up to his mother. Hugo tells the parents where all the teens are partying and the parents get very angry.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The police show up at the bar with the teenagers and arrest Conrad. Kim blames her behavior on Conrad and gets back with Hugo. Rosie and Albert get back together, both ignoring his mother’s wishes. Albert bails Conrad out of jail and sneaks him out of town on a train with his mother as well. Once Albert is free of those two burdens on his life, he and Rosie get engaged and move to Iowa for him to become an English teacher like he promised her at the beginning of the show.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p></div>
