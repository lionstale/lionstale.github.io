    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p>Having moved to my first International School only three years ago, I have had the chance to experience two entirely different worlds, both with their upsides and their downsides and, above all, both being two important life experiences.
</p><p><br></p><p>Changing schools is difficult for everyone, and we all wonder and worry that we might not fit in. However, when moving from an ordinary school in your own country to an international school, the sensation is ten times stronger. Or, at least, that’s the way it’s been for me. And indeed, a great amount of this worry has originated from my own prejudice and overthinking. On one hand, when we think of an international school, we can imagine this amazing mix of people coming from everywhere and working together, learning together, respecting each other, and appreciating each other’s countries and cultures. We get to be fascinated by the idea of all these really different people studying in the same place. As we think more about this, we may get anxious about one crucial detail: how do you get close to someone from another country if the mother tongues are different? Yes, we all know English pretty well, but can’t that be a barrier? Isn’t it preventing us from saying some things which we could have expressed much more easily in our own language? Isn’t it causing us to be misunderstood? How can you know if your English even is good enough? Those were the kind of things I asked myself as I was about to enter the international realm for the first time. It was exciting, but also scary and a bit too difficult to visualize. It is the type of thing you can never be sure of beforehand, but you can dream about and think about and even worry about, while praying for the best outcome.
</p><p><br></p><p>When entering the international realm, everything proved to be, somehow, different from the millions of scenarios I had imagined. It is a great and intense experience, and surely very different from a community composed solely of people from your own country. At first, you feel that what is being spoken around you does not really make sense, you try to take it all in, some things pass you by, and it can be very frustrating, not understanding in the way you would like to. People speak English in many ways, some better, some worse, some with strong accents, some without any noticeable accent. It’s a very interesting thing to hear, English being spoken in so many different manners. Although a lack of understanding can feel lonely, when you slowly start to develop connections with the people around, you are amazed by how the differences you, either cultural or linguistical, are a great thing. It’s like getting a taste of the world, and that is a feeling that cannot be captured in words. Yes, sometimes the fact that we all try to speak this one language may prevent us from connecting the way we would like to, but that’s alright, as we get to learn develop connections with people more slowly, but maybe in a way that will last longer. When language does not completely suffice, we learn to listen, and that is something many people forget to do. Listening, helping each other, smiling, or saying kind words like, “I hope your day is going well”, are things that in international communities we manage to do more often. In this way, the language barrier disappears, and we realize that this experience will be worth it, that amazing people can be found everywhere, and that differences are great.</p><p><br></p><p> 
</p><p>For sure, I have learned more during three years in the International Community than in the eight years among people of my own nationality, because I have gotten to know so many different kinds of people and have started to comprehend how different cultures work. One thing to understand in an International Community is that we are all shaped by the countries we come from, hence we all think, speak, and act differently. Of course, there are also people from the same country who choose to stick together because of the cultural and linguistic connections. However, when we set the language problem aside and choose to embrace the differences between us, allowing ourselves to grow from them, learning to listen and being more supportive of others, we can form the most amazing and long-lasting friendships. It can be difficult, but it is more than worth it!</p><p><br></p><p>
</p><p>And surely, nothing is more exciting than imagining how, in the future, we will travel the world, cross oceans, and mountains just to see our international friends. When there is understanding beyond words or cultural origins, nothing else really matters.</p></div>
