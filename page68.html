To address this, some of the episodes in the ‘For Dummies’ series will keep you up to date with the rough picture of politics and things relating to the economy.</p><p><br></p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This ‘For Dummies’ episode is on fiscal policy. Fiscal policy might be a term that sounds complicated, but it really isn’t. Fiscal policy refers to government decisions regarding tax cuts and state spending. The government changes their spending and taxing to regulate the country’s level of economic activity. Why is that important? In short, a country with a high level of economic activity is usually also a country with a high standard of living. In other words, its nicer to live there. Unfortunately, in the real world, and in newspapers, people won’t be talking like that. They’ll talk about GDP. Take all the stuff <strong>1</strong> &nbsp;a country makes in a year and put a price tag on it… that’s GDP, and the rough way to measure a country’s cost of living is by dividing that big price tag by the number of people in the country. That’s called GDP per capita. Yeah, pretty fancy.
</p><p>&nbsp;
</p><p>The government spends money and cuts taxes in order to increase the country’s level of economic activity. You might see or hear that as “government spending” or “government expenditure” and impressive terms like that. Don’t worry though, it’s just paying for stuff, like roads, education, or giving money to companies (the wise-guys will call that a subsidy) so they can produce more at a lower price. So, when the government spends more on the homeland, and cuts taxes, allowing people more money left over from their paychecks, more things are bought in the economy. This is called an increase in demand (aggregate demand, more specifically <strong>2</strong>). More people want more of the things that the economy has to offer. This makes companies produce more products, and that makes the end of year price tag, the GDP, bigger! So, assuming the country’s population stays the same, GDP per capita, or the quality of life, goes up! That’s what we want. It’s gnarly.</p><p><br></p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>But then why would a government increase taxes, and spend less? That would decrease the level of economic activity, and as a result, the standard of living would decrease. If a government cuts taxes TOO much, and spends TOO much, then we arrive at a problem. More and more products are bought, are wanted. The more people want something, the more the price for it goes up. This can be thought of in ‘hypebeast’ terms.  Take Supreme clothing, for instance. Everybody wants Supreme clothes, and there isn’t a whole lot of it. So, the prices get totally jacked out of proportion, because if everyone is fighting for something that only you have, then you can charge the boys absolutely whatever you want (they’ll buy it no matter what, it makes them cooler!). Now take that idea of rising prices due to lots of demand and apply it to all the stuff bought in an economy. If everyone ends up with more money on their hands, from the tax cuts, and the government is also buying a bunch of products, whether directly or through projects, then the average prices start to go up. The average prices will be referred to as the price level by your economics teacher, and the steady rise of the price level will be called inflation by your smart uncle. Why is inflation bad? Well, as prices go up, the amount of goods you can buy goes down. If you have $1000 and the price of a Supreme T-shirt goes from $400 to $600, then you go from being able to buy 2 T-shirts (lucky you) to being able to buy just 1! That not fresh, and everyone agrees. That’s why inflation is bad, and that’s why sometimes even though output <strong>3</strong> &nbsp;is rocking, you (the government) need to raise taxes a bit and cut spending. This keeps the price level stable, and nothing hits the fan.</p><p><br></p><p> 
</p><p>
</p><p>Now, for an example. In 2008, the U.S. suffered from the Financial Crisis <strong>4</strong>. This crisis caused many people to lose their jobs, their homes, and their trust in the system. That’s a recession, a big decrease in economic activity – in GDP. So, people went into survival mode, and put all their money in savings. That’s where fiscal policy comes in. The president at the time, Barack Obama, proposed an act to buy stuff and get more people to buy goods and services and get the level of economic activity up <strong>5</strong>. It was called the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), and it’s a form of what all the reporters call an economic stimulus package. Congress passed the bill, and $787 billion dollars were injected into the country, via tax cuts and spending increases, over the next few years. The state spent money on education, health care, and infrastructure like the energy sector.</p><p><br></p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Monetary policy, another useful way to regulate the level of economic activity, political influences in fiscal policymaking, and methods of introducing new laws and actions of the state (legislation) will be discussed in other episodes of ‘For Dummies.’</p><p><br></p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Finishing off, fiscal policy is what the government does to regulate the level of economic activity and do its best to improve the quality of life in a nation. The basic tools of fiscal policy are taxes and spending. Now, you can hopefully follow along with the post-dinner adult conversations with a bit more ease and can figure out for yourself whether all this is interesting, or just people trying to act sophisticated.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1 </strong>Stuff, in this article, refers to items, products, goods and services. It’s things that are produced inside the country (domestic products).</p><p><strong>2 </strong>Aggregate demand is all the products that are bought/wanted by people, companies, the government, and foreigners. Aggregate demand is what’s meant by demand in this episode.</p><p><strong>3 </strong>GDP, the big price tag. Output is how many things are getting made.</p><p><strong>4</strong> For future reference, the Financial Crisis is basically when something hit the fan in ’08. Big banks defaulted due to a couple years’ worth of bad and risky decision-making. This resulted from the government relaxing restrictions on the financial markets in the 90s (financial deregulation).</p><p><strong>5</strong> Side note: More people buying stuff makes more people get hired, because people have to make stuff!</p><p>
