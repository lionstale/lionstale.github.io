            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p>“I met Joan Farrell at the beginning of the 2015-2016 school year. She came to St Johns from Ireland on a one-year maternity contract, filling in for Ms. Borgmastars. Although she enjoyed her life teaching in Ireland, she had gotten to a point in her career where she was ready for an adventure, or at the very least, something new. She went to a jobs fair and was offered positions in China and Kazakhstan, in addition to Belgium. Wanting not to go too far from home, thankfully, she chose the latter.
</p><p><br></p><p>Joan claims that when we first met in the St. John’s cafeteria it was love at first sight for her. For me, just having recently divorced and moved into an apartment on my own, I suppose I wasn’t in the same head-space of looking for love. I did notice she had many rings on her fingers, so I assumed she was married. For the first two months or so of the year, we really didn’t chat much or hang out at all. I was completely oblivious to the fact that she liked me. 
</p><p><br></p><p>In an effort to grab my attention, Joan threw a little party at her apartment, to which she invited a number of our colleagues. She made sure to invite Mr. Prowse, who, at the time, I was carpooling with to and from Leuven where I live.  We had tapas and played Cards Against Humanity. At a certain point in the evening, it became evident that Joan was a lot more interested in me than our other colleagues and after kissing me out on her balcony, asked me if I wanted to go on a date. I said sure. When it came to actually setting the date, I said, “Let’s play it by ear.” And then I sort of forgot to actually set the date.
</p><p><br></p><p>A week went by and Joan was really regretting having revealed her amorous intentions as I seemed to be blowing her off. In my defense, there was a serious refugee crisis going on at the time and I had small Afghani family living with me, so I was a bit distracted. Anyway, a mutual friend asked me at the end of the week if I ever went out on the date with Joan and scolded me when I said I had neglected to set it. I finally went up to her, quite sheepish, and asked her out to dinner to her great relief. One date led to the next, and we very quickly realized how well we interacted and how much we had in common. We fell in love and I’m happy to say that every day I love her even more than the last. I went from the world’s biggest sceptic about love to a believer in soul mates within an incredibly short span of time. Our story is living proof that just about anything can happen with love.”

She was a swimming coach and was working on our campus, using our facilities for an external company. That was when she and I first started talking and then she started working with some of our elite athletes at the university. Suddenly, I started to take more of an interest in swimming – I was spending a lot more time at the sports swimming pool, trying to ‘woo’ her. What’s it called? When you’re in that period of trying to impress somebody?”
