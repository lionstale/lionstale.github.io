    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p>Alan Krueger—a renowned labor economist and professor at Princeton University who served as the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors under the Obama Administration—died recently. His cause of death: suicide. While I didn’t know much of his work, I was startled by the news, and went about reading his obituaries which briefly dominated the news. He is famous in the academic community for his empirically-driven research on macroeconomic subjects such as the minimum wage’s effects on employment, the Great Gatsby Curve – research which revealed that a more unequal income distribution in society is correlated to diminished intergenerational socio-economic mobility—and the corporate abuse of worker’s rights in America. He’s described by journalists, peers, and Barack Obama as having a deep care for the welfare of workers; as seeking practical applications of his findings, numbers, and theories to benefit the laborers who form the backbone of society, and who all too often find themselves on the losing end of it all.</p><p><br></p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My fascination with Mr. Krueger is not so much that he killed himself or the work that he did, but rather why he decided to take his life. While there certainly may have been—and probably were—conditions in his personal life which drove him to such a decision, I keep thinking back to a quote from him in an article in the Princeton Alumni Weekly, in which he says, “It’s hard not to be too pessimistic about our system, because you have expectations for Congress to do the people’s business and it’s not. It’s dysfunctional. I feel that frustration as much as anybody.”</p><p><br></p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The quote brings me back to myself, and the pessimistic thoughts which sometimes plague me when I read the news. Global warming is reaching alarming levels and income inequality is rising in both the UK and US, which, according to Mr. Krueger, should lead to very low economic mobility in the next decade – an eventuality that will be detrimental to economic growth, the welfare of individuals, and the contention of meritocracy in many modern states. These issues are being met with a number of populist leaders who, instead of attempting to address them, employ scare-tactics and xenophobic rhetoric in order to promote their own political support among the masses, while purporting to eliminate an elite which they are a part of, and whose payroll they’re on. Meanwhile, partisan tribalism, corporatist influences in the upper echelons of executive government, collapsing welfare states, outdated electoral systems, and heavy propaganda form the seismic waves which seem to fissure our beloved democracies at their very foundations.</p><p><br></p><p> 
</p><p>
</p><p>The possibility—although improbable—that a man whose life was defined by rational utilitarian and consequentialist assessments, inspired by a deep care for the welfare of society’s constituents, could ultimately decide that the benefit of living was outweighed by its cost, is intensely worrying to me. If Mr. Krueger, a man who stood as a beacon of selflessness and humanism in a sea of self-interest and cutthroat politics, decided that it wasn’t worth it, then why should any of us fight for what we believe in? Why shouldn’t we succumb to pessimism and passivity, and resign ourselves to a life of self-indulgence and hedonism, before we die or the ship sinks? After bemoaning the decision of millions of low-income Americans to elect a President who advocated for the eradication of their health-care plans without stopping to think about the implications, the least that I can do, and that we should do, is to discover the answers to these questions ourselves and not accept the judgements of others. This is ‘Pessimism v. Optimism,’ and ‘Passivity v. Dynamism.’ I believe in optimism and dynamism, and here’s why.</p><p><br></p><p> 
</p><p>
</p><p>The main reason why I think that pessimism should be reconsidered is its roots in the media. In their book Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media, Noam Chomsky and Edward S. Herman lay out their reasons (advertising, sourcing, ownership, flak, and fear) as to why the mass media propagates a systemic bias in their publications. The authors posit that mass media’s main sources of revenue come from advertising, that they are often a part of greater corporations or conglomerations (think mega-media owner Rupert Murdoch, whose 800 newspapers and many television stations somehow all praised or were neutral to Tony Blair during the general elections of 1997, 2001, and 2005.), and that fear plays an important role in their maintenance of attention among readers. It isn’t that readers want to feel fear, or that fear in and of itself causes one to buy newspapers. It is simply an inherent biological trait that has permitted us to survive for millennia. Traditionally, fear causes a heightened awareness of one’s surroundings, but today, fear is instilled through the media, and our only way of increasing our awareness is to go back to the media. This shows us two things: that fear is an effective instrument for profit-seeking media firms (it maintains and/or increases demand) and that the fear which is instilled in us often cannot be verified in our immediate surroundings. I’m not saying that journalists are liars, I’m only saying that, by framing issues in a sensationalist manner, and by making claims that these issues have implications with regards to our personal safety, the media imposes on us a pessimistic outlook which can be (to an extent!) ill-founded.</p><p><br></p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>History itself is the lens through which my optimism is strongest. However, it can’t be denied that human history is marred with violence, oppression, and suffering. It is true that Thomas Sankara, the African Che Guevara, was murdered by his friend and colleague, and that Abraham Lincoln, the man who freed slaves in America and moved the world closer to true equality, was shot dead at Ford’s theater. But the malicious ploys of Blaise Compaoré and John Wilkes Booth pale in comparison to the greatness which they attempted to put an end to. The emancipation of slaves in America cannot ever be reversed, and the eventuality of African determinism is one which is not far off, and one which is increasingly embraced by the continent and the African diaspora in a number of ways. History is beautiful in that it attributes a transcendent significance—another life—to events and lives at their end. The tragedy of events gives way to the outset of another, whether intangible or not. The horrors of the First World War coincided with the liberalization of women’s roles in society, the enfranchisement of women in Britain and the USA, and paved the way for the feminist movements of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.</p><p><br></p><p>

This was a massive leap forward for the United States, and set the stage for staggering levels of economic activity and growth in the post-war period.

</p><p>In 1860, Giuseppe Garibaldi led 1000 men across Southern Italy, regaining land from Bourbon rulers, and delivering it to the King Vittorio Emmanuelle II and the House of Savoy, thus eradicating Italy of its foreign influences and rulers. Garibaldi didn’t come from a rich background, and his men had no significant warfare expertise. He was the son of a sea-merchant who, after travelling to South America and learning guerilla tactics, reclaimed the South of Italy through charismatic leadership and sheer force of will.</p><p><br></p><p> 
</p><p>
</p><p>The following year, Alexander II emancipated the Russian serfs. He claimed: “it is better to abolish serfdom from above, than to wait for that time when it starts to abolish itself from below.” His motives were pragmatic enough, but in giving the citizenry a taste of freedom, he opened Pandora’s box. A series of assassination attempts—driven by an impetus towards further reform—turned him into a reactionary of sorts before his assassination in 1881. His grandson, Nicholas II, experienced the full might of a consciously oppressed people—a populace which transcended the propaganda which formed the bonds of its previous enslavement—when Russia’s participation in the First World War imposed a colossal cost in terms of welfare and life itself. He was forced to abdicate, and subsequently met his brutal end.</p><p><br></p><p>

</p><p>What does all this mean? It means that the people ultimately have the power, regardless of structures of governance. It means that an inefficient and unequal society cannot last when its constituents gain awareness and transcend their illusory chains. It also means that action, not stagnancy, provides results. When Martin Luther King Jr. said, “the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice,” it wasn’t a prophecy, or a proclamation of determinism. It was a belief in the power of the human spirit—of the collective—which, when transformed into movements, uprisings, and revolutions, can accomplish no less than exactly what it sets out to do.</p><p><br></p><p> 
</p><p>
</p><p>Given this big picture, it’s hard to see the current state of the modern world as hopeless. The people of this Earth are not so dissimilar. We are all rational in our heads, and desiring of security and freedom for ourselves and others. After all, if this weren’t true, why would we have joined together in this great collective effort masked behind the word ‘society’—the work of billions before us who, acting the basis of their virtuous and humanistic convictions, worked tirelessly for the better lives we live today. These freedom-fighters received nothing in return, and their names remain lost to history. But the monument of their achievement lasts – both a testament to the power of time and will, and an inspiration for us not to let their labor become fruitless and to build upon it in their honor, and with the aspiration of a better future for those who succeed us.</p><p><br></p><p> 
</p><p>
</p><p>A modernized and practical application of this inspiration can be expressed as the power of the vote. As Mr. Macdonald told me, “the 1% may have all the wealth, but the 99% have the votes!” We would do well to remember that in times of despair.</p><p><br></p><p> 
</p><p>
</p><p>When Barack Obama repeated Martin Luther King Jr.’s quote to a crowd of 5,000 university students, he added, “but here’s the thing, young people. It [the moral arc of the universe] doesn’t bend on its own.” We must engage with our democracies, rather than be skeptical of them, as is our role as citizens. Change may be instantaneous at times, but it is thrown into being by the mounting pressure that is the need and desire of the people. Why can’t we pass a bill which bans lobbying and corporate sponsorship of politicians? Why shouldn’t we ban coal consumption? Food stamps are a lasting form a paternalism in so-called free societies; let’s try universal basic income. Structural racism is a social construct; let’s deconstruct it. Workers’ rights are being infringed by no-poach agreements, anti-compete clauses, and anti-competitive mergers; let’s introduce new anti-trust laws. Just because corporations seem to be one step ahead of us doesn’t mean we can’t dance with them. The existence of the electoral college has failed to uphold the principles of American representative democracy; let’s take it out! Why can’t we, and why shouldn’t we? Let’s meet the rise of surveillance capitalism with a rise in privacy laws—privacy laws drafted by people who understand exactly how technology companies function. The Second Amendment was drafted at a time when a firearm could discharge two times per minute, but only if the shooter was an absolute pro. Claiming that ratifying the constitution violates its integrity is denying the historical core of truth, and arguing that truth is invariable against the movement of time. Nonsense! We have needs to be met in this day and age which are fundamentally different from those of hundreds of years ago. Angela Duckworth wrote, “necessity is the mother of adaptation.” Well, we need things now, so let’s adapt. Change can be difficult to bring about, and getting up will always be harder than staying seated. But should that deter us? Absolutely not. It didn’t deter Garibaldi, and Italy is now a thing.</p><p><br></p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Extreme poverty is finally close to being eradicated (2030 projection), but almost half of the world population still lives on less than $5.50 per day. If we could accomplish the former, why can’t we accomplish the latter? And why shouldn’t we? After all, lower income disparity equates to a higher standard of living, and better economic growth. The issues which face us today are not partisan issues, they’re ecological and humanitarian. The only reason why the politics of today are so divided is because of hidden agendas and uncompromising personalities. The red scare is over. Corporatism can meet its end at our hands. We can proceed without the hindering indoctrinations which plagued our predecessors.</p><p><br></p><p> 
</p><p>
</p><p>The fact that Hillary Clinton received more votes than Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election should catalyze a push towards the ideal democracy which America purports to have, and which its people deserve, as a matter of principle.</p><p><br></p><p> 
</p><p>
</p><p>I don’t know why Alan Krueger chose to withdraw from life. I respect his decision to do so, and hope that his family and community can come to terms with it positively. But that isn’t the point. The worry which I experienced in the wake of his death was ill-founded. I can take pleasure and inspiration in Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s dissenting opinions; the Prime Minister of New Zealand’s commitment to immediate crisis response; Brandon Stanton’s devotion to the documentation and exposure of the lives of all members of society; Bernie Sanders’ ruthless criticism of the Trump Administration’s proposed budget and defense of people’s rights; the Algerian people’s refusal to accept anything other than a regime change; Greta Thunberg’s fearless assertion that “political leaders’ legacy will be the greatest failure of human history” if they fail to correct our contributions to global warming; and Rutger Bregman calling out the elite for their hypocrisy, and calling on the youth to be unafraid of stances which are dubbed extreme.</p><p><br></p><p> 
</p><p>
</p><p>It will soon be our generation’s turn at the helm. As the future helmsmen and helmswomen of society, we have no power over the conditions we inherit when we take charge. However, the possibilities of the conditions which we pass on to the next helmsmen are unimaginably wide-ranging. We shouldn’t underestimate the amount of power we have when it comes to determining the societal conditions which future generations will inherit.
