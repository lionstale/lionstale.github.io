    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p>When we “embark” into our two final years of highschool, a long journey of deadlines and expectations also begins. This journey presumably leads us towards that much needed diploma, towards that dream university, and towards the independent (supposedly) adult life.</p><p><br></p><p> 
</p><p>But as you experience these two years, you start to realize that many beautiful moments are collected along the way as well. Yes, there are quite a few long days spent studying (or procrastinating). There is stress, loads of projects and deadlines, the period of anticipation after having applied to university and hoping to be accepted into your dream school. There are the weeks before and during exams which, as any 12th grader can attest, are not much fun. Adding sports, musicals and CAS to that, the mixture is complete! There are times when it all feels like too much, and there are times when ‘too much’ becomes ‘not enough’. Through harder times, we felt more united than ever, because we were all facing them together (and therefore getting to laugh and have some fun along the way!) As we reached the final months of high-school and graduation seems closer than ever, we are all trying to surpass our remaining difficulties, doubts and challenges, as well as find answers for whatever is still unclear. 
</p><p><br></p><p>Still, having been caught in this seemingly endless cycle of “to-dos” for the past few months, I noticed how easy it can be to forget to appreciate the present and the time we have left in highschool. We always and constantly think of the ‘big picture’, incessantly projecting ourselves into the future. We no longer stand still enough to notice, in the hectic rush of each day, the beautiful, but temporary moments that (really) matter. Beyond the stress and the expectations are the families and friends who stand by us every day, and the teachers whose warm voices we will surely miss. We have them by our side every day, so we often forget to fully appreciate them and feel thankful for their presence. This warm, cheerful familiarity will soon be passing us all by, and we may not encounter it anywhere else very soon.</p><p><br></p><p>
</p><p>Of course, it is exciting to think of the different places from all around the world, or fields of study each of us are going for! What was once 12th grade, all together at St. John’s, will in a year’s time be a multitude of names scattered on the map. The end of an adventure means the beginning of a new one for each of us.
</p><p><br></p><p>But after maybe a couple years, after having climbed that high mountain and already peeking at the next, we will look back to <em>this</em> time and to highschool. The way we will remember it will not be the “I am glad it’s over” kind of way, but rather the “I wish I could re-live some of those moments once again!” The true value of each day and of each moment is the fact that it does not last forever (fortunately or not) and that it can only be experienced once, in its own particular way. 
</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;<em>Just like highschool.
