    <div class="container">

            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p>There are four parts to applying to the US: standardized tests, academic transcript, extra curriculars, and application essays. I will cover each of these as well as the Common Application.</p><p><br></p><p>The relationship between US applications and standardized tests is quite infamous with many people thinking a low score to be absolutely damning for an application. In reality, standardized tests are but one component of the application, and a worse score can be made up for elsewhere. However, this is not to say they don’t matter. A high score for a standardized test can be very helpful. There are five types of standardized tests you are likely to encounter: the SAT, ACT, SAT subject tests, AP, and IB. Almost every university in the US will require you to either take the SAT or ACT. The SAT has math, writing, and reading sections, as well as an optional essay. The total score is out of 1600, with math counting for 800 and reading and writing counting for a combined 800. The optional essay is marked out of 24. The ACT has English, math, reading, and science sections as well as an optional essay. Each section is scored out of 36 with your composite score being the average of the sections. Both the SAT and ACT have ‘pre’ exams which can be useful in providing an idea of their differences and which test best suits you. Both of the tests can be taken repeatedly so set your sights on a minimum score you need and you can try multiple times to achieve it, if necessary. SAT subjects tests are not required by most universities, but when they are you will often have to do two. If given a choice, do some research to choose the tests you feel you can perform best on. AP and IB exams are also subject based and often worth college credit. They are never required by universities but can be useful to set yourself at a higher academic standing than similar applicants.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Your academic transcript is a record of your grades throughout high school. Just as universities have expectations for standardized tests, they will have similar expectations for your results in school. Your academic transcript is often measured through an average, or GPA, which will take into account the difficulty of classes, as well as the score to more accurately compare students.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Extracurriculars include activities like sports, performing arts, community service, and pretty much anything else beyond academics. Universities in the US place a significant emphasis on these activities, especially the higher ranked ones. When listing extracurriculars, quantity is not of importance but rather longstanding dedication. Examples like playing volleyball for years moving up from junior varsity, to varsity, to eventually being team captain show universities your commitment and what you can bring them beyond academics. You often hear that universities want you to be ‘well-rounded,’ but in truth it is often more important to show there’s something you have a real longstanding passion for which will make you out to be unique amongst many similar students.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Application essays are your chance to show universities who you are as a person. Prompts will often focus on things like extracurriculars, challenges, background, or something about the university itself. What is important to remember is that these essays are not places to list facts or make an argument, but rather express your personality in a way descriptions and scores can not. These essays will make or break an application so make sure to work through multiple drafts and get feedback wherever you can to develop the best possible work.</p><p><br></p><p>The majority of universities in the US run their applications through a system called the Common Application. The Common Application allows you to input most of your data only a single time rather than repeatedly for each university. It also has a specific essay which is sent to every university, in addition to the other essays particular universities may require. It is reasonably straightforward and it is worth opening an account as soon as possible during the application season.</p></div>
