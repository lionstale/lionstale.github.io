    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p>Paper 1 - this is a multiple choice paper which is worth 20% at HL and is 1 hour in length. The only advice that I can give for this paper is to practice and once you’ve done that, practice some more. Firstly, the questions often reappear in very similar formats between years. Also, you start understanding the way they ask questions and what exactly the IB is looking for. When you do questions and get them wrong, don’t just accept that you got it wrong but try to find what went wrong: was it because you didn’t know the information or because you fell into one of the IB’s notorious traps? This is important since the IB does try to trick you in these questions as it is really testing the nitty gritty parts of the syllabus.</p><p><br></p><p>Paper 2 - this is a longer paper focusing on all of the core (SL and HL) information. For HL, this is worth 36% and is, therefore, the component worth the most. What is important in these questions is looking for the connections between questions; this is very important.  If you feel that you are struggling on questions, it is very possible that this part is leaning on the previous part. Therefore, if you are really struggling, it might be a good idea to look back at other sections. More than just looking at the connections between questions, it is paramount that you learn the syllabus in a way that allows you to see the connections between different chapters of the course, as this will prepare you best for this examination.</p><p><br></p><p>Paper 3 - this is the experimental and data based questions and option paper, worth 24% in total. The first 15 marks are based on the prescribed experiments that you learn and other practical applications of the course. For this, the best preparation is thinking about experimental procedures, specifically to all of the ones that you have done throughout the two years of the IB. By knowing these well, and using common sense during the exam, then you will be able to score highly in this section. The final 30 marks of the paper are based on the option. This is one area chosen out of four options. Theoretically, this gives you the option to explore in more detail one area of the science that interests you the most in detail. The option is usually a straightforward section, if you’ve devoted enough time to really exploring all the content. It is essential, however, that you still commit enough time to it to ensure that you do well. Many people focus more on paper 1 and paper 2 since they assume paper 3 is easy. While it may be an easier paper, it might then be easier to do better on it. In summary, don’t ignore the importance of this paper.</p></div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p>For the external exams, the best way I found to revise the syllabus was to find the syllabus online and go through every single point, either by myself or with a group of friends, and make sure that I understand the necessary information to be able to answer any question posed on that point. I think this is a good way to revise because it means that you will get through all of the syllabus without fail and you might even spot pieces of information that were overlooked slightly in the classroom.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Internal Assessment - this is an investigation worth 20% of your final grade. There are only two pieces of advice I think should be given out are the following: don’t get too bogged down in Personal Engagement and to use your teacher! One of the marking criteria is personal engagement and it is important to try and score highly here as it is easy to gain marks. This does not mean making things up to feign an interest in your topic, but instead means that you need to show original thought and input. One way to do this is by comparing your experiment to similar ones online and trying to find a different way of conducting it which will result in it becoming more unique. For the second piece of advice, the teachers know the IA best. It is important to have your drafts done on time so that they can have enough time to give you relevant feedback. It is essential that you get as much feedback from them as possible, as this is the way you will be graded more highly.</p><p><br></p><p>Good luck!</p></div>
