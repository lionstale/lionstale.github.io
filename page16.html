The typical aspirations of millenniums are often: to be a singer, YouTuber, entrepreneur, to enjoy a free education, or to have just as many followers on Instagram as you can. However, the dream in war-torn countries is very different. These young people just want to live in a safe and happy place. They crave security and often they arrive in Europe via Italy with a very optimistic view of this new land and quest for a bright future. Unfortunately, for many, Europe is not quite as it seems and, often they are faced with obstacles and sometimes subjected to situations where they are assaulted, molested, and forced into things that they do not want to do, just in order to survive.</p><p>

</p><p>In an article published by the BBC “Exploited and abandoned: A child's journey to Europe,” I read into the traumatic stories of the under-18’s crossing into Europe from countries such as Syria, Eritrea, and Afghanistan. (1) I continue to be amazed by how resilient they are as they leave their homes and have to endure a journey during which often experiencing abuse and trauma in search for their new life. Unfortunately, the rape and abuse often does not end after arriving in Italy, as these minors are brought into illegal work and business. Khaled at 14, not too much younger than myself, sells drugs so that he can afford to buy food for himself. In his words “I did it to avoid doing what other boys I know here are doing- having (sexual relations) with Italian men. I’ve seen it with my own eyes.” While this whole phrase is heart rending, the very last words ‘I’ve seen it with my own eyes,’ shows the true horror and trauma that has resided with Khaled. This is only one of many stories.
</p><p>Ruth is a 19-year old Nigerian girl who had been an aspiring gospel singer and actress in her hometown Lagos. She left her home because her “family were suffering,” and barely had enough food to survive. (2) While on her journey out of Nigeria, like many other girls, Ruth’s traffickers tried to force her into prostitution, and while she refused, this meant that she had to find another way to compensate her traffickers. Her only other option was to accept the offer of an older Ghanaian man who she had recently met to enter into a relationship with him for money. Soon after, she fell pregnant with his child. (3) I found this particularly awful and even more desolate given that she had not yet even embarked on her journey to Italy. After arriving in Italy, she was asked what advice she would give anyone considering this journey and she admitted, “I would advise the person not come at all. Even if I heard of my sister…I would tell them to arrest her so she wouldn’t move…The journey is not good… They should not even try it. If I had known these things would happen I wouldn’t come.” (4)</p><p>

            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p>Hamid, another teenager, has already been previously convicted and spent time in jail for selling drugs. He calls his mother every week reassuring her that everything is fine, when in fact everything is not fine. (5) Thankfully, I know I will never be in a position where I feel so unsafe and vulnerable. I think we can all agree that we are all blessed to live in a safe community where we do not have to deal with feeling misplaced every day of our lives.</p><p><br></p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>While Italy provides centers for minors, they only have a few translators who speak the children’s languages and staff often do not reach out or are not equipped to deal with victims of sexual exploitation. Therefore, a large number of these minors feel no purpose and no longer feel safe in these centers. They are forced to find an alternative survival route on the streets. Fabio Sorgoni, a member of the Italian charity On the Road, told the BBC that “feeling uncertain and unprotected, thousands of children have run away from Italian reception centres, disappearing on to streets.” (6)</p><p><br></p><p>
</p><p>While the stories of these three teenagers have been heard, there are estimated to be over of 50,000 migrant children who have travelled to Europe this year, many of whom have experienced identical traumas, whose voices and stories will never be acknowledged. Federica Mogherini, High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, said last month in the European summit that “we need unity of purpose, a coordinated international and regional effort under the umbrella of the UN.” Delving more into this topic has made me reflect that living in our privileged environment, the onus is on my generation to settle this migration crisis, recognize their plight, hear their voices, and ensure everyone has equal opportunities to live their dream.</p></div>
