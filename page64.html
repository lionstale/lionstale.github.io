    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p><strong>Teacher Introductions</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Almost all PE teachers will be referenced by their first names because somehow their last names are all terribly hard to pronounce.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Señora Bartolome</strong></p><p><em>Roles in the School: Spanish Teacher</em></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Señora Bartolome is a Spanish teacher. Being one of the moodlers you must remember to check it constantly, remember teachers can check to see who’s been on the page. She talks fast, even for native speakers so don’t worry about not catching what it is she’s saying. She’s does take school seriously and will make you work, but you’ll have fun during most of her classes. Speaking to her is always nice (Warning to native spanish speakers, she does keep going forever), she will always surprise you with very Spanish sayings. Regardless of her height she is hard to miss, and will make herself heard. All around a nice teacher.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ms. Boehman</strong></p><p><em>Roles in the School: English Teacher</em></p><p><br></p><p>For those of you who haven’t met her yet, Ms. Boehman is the new teacher for IB Literature. For those of us who do have lessons with her though, we can all agree she is one of the coolest teachers out there. She has the ability to keep us relaxed even in stressful times and reading plays together as a class always puts us in a high mood. Ms. Boehman is also there to help and guide us through the many challenges of the IB (and they never seem to end), but with her as a teacher, one can always overcome them (although sometimes it’s hard to find her outside class because she seems to be everywhere around the school).</p><p><br></p><p>In addition to being a great English teacher and a super cool person, Ms. Boehman is also very passionate about Japan and is always excited to share a bit of it with us.</p><p><br></p><p>As Literature students can easily agree, the classes with Ms. Boehman could never be more… lit!</p><p><br></p><p>P.S. To do well in her class, you should seek advice even outside of class time, be involved, and take pleasure in the subject</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Mrs. Briggs</strong></p><p><em>Roles in the School: Math Teacher</em></p><p><br></p><p>She is a kind and fair teacher and although she is a seventh grade advisor, her door is always open if you need help or just someone to talk to. Mrs. Briggs’s room is located at the end of the 7th grade hallway where you can sometimes hear her enthusiastic voice. She is professional while in class and has a great sense of humour.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Carlin&nbsp;</strong></p><p><em>Roles in the School: Physics teacher, 10th Grade Advisor, and Programming Club Supervisor</em></p><p><br></p><p>Guitar enthusiast, proud Scotsman, and Physics teacher. Inhabiting the school’s only physics lab, you will always have him if you take any high school physics class. He greatly enjoys showing off all his gadgets and devices.</p><p><br></p><p>He is also friendly and welcoming, and is very patient with students in class. Be warned though, if you push him too far you’ll find out how scary the Scots can be! Forests everywhere are also terrified, as he hands out more packets than any other teacher.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Castillo</strong></p><p><em>Roles in the School: Religious Studies Teacher, TOK Teacher, Head of the Myth-Busters Club, 11th Grade Leader</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Castillo is, above all, a wise man. He can tell you the whole history of religion in a long lecture, if you’re willing to listen. Many students miss his insightful teachings by not paying attention in class. However, Dr. Castillo is always patient and tolerant and hopes that, at one point or another, you learn something for life. If you beg for a long time, he might even play “Jesus Cristo” on his guitar and sing to the class or have a subtle (not so subtle) roast session of the class which makes you rethink your life. In TOK, you will often wonder if you ever left the religious studies class, but, we assure you, it is actually a class presented from a different perspective. Try to pay attention to TOK and, if in doubt, look at example essays and presentations online.</p><p><br></p><p>P.S. He will do his best not to fail you, thank Jesus.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Colotto&nbsp;</strong></p><p><em>Roles in the School: Math Teacher and Learning Support</em></p><p><br></p><p>Dr. Colotto is a lovely person whose genius often goes underappreciated. Many do not know that in addition to being a math teacher, she also has a PHD in Physics. In class, she tries her best to keep everyone focussed and will even give out lollipops once in a while to people who point out her mistakes on the board (which there are sometimes a lot of… yay Type 2 Diabetes on its way for all of us - just kidding :P.) She is known for giving out many packets for homework and often using a teach on the board then do practice problems method of teaching. Dr. Colotto will always listen to a student’s concerns and is very good at explaining one on one, so if you’re confused by the lesson, talk to her out of class.&nbsp;</p><p>P.S. If you ever need a pep talk about your life and the future, she is an excellent, supportive person to talk to.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Ms. Cooke</strong></p><p><em>Roles in the School: Middle and High School Assistant Principal, Math Subject Leader, and Math Teacher</em></p><p><br></p><p>Ms. Cooke is the much-loved Middle and High School Assistant Principal. She is someone whose door is always open to help you with any social or academic concerns you may have. She is also an avid school sports and arts supporter (as long as you hand in your assignment sheet). Her math classes often involve learning through demonstration and practice, and while this can sometimes be difficult to follow at the time, it is always helpful when trying to remember concepts on the final exam. Whilst Assistant Principals often get the reputation of being too strict, Ms. Cooke manages to be fair, though still tough.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Mr. Cox&nbsp;</strong></p><p><em>Roles in the School: MHS Learning Support Teacher</em></p><p><br></p><p>Mr. Cox is a new teacher from the US who grew up in Texas. He most recently taught at a public high school in Washington DC right next to the Capitol Building. He studied Politics and Law, but decided to focus on teaching and sustaining inclusive learning environments.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>He is quite introverted and enjoys writing and editing, making him quite interested in guiding student writing projects. He has a wide range of interest including visiting museums, learning languages, reading novels, cooking vegetarian dishes, and taking long walks. He is excited for the new adventure which his move to Belgium will be and looking forward to meeting STJ’s students.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ms. D’Agostino&nbsp;</strong></p><p><em>Roles in the school: IB Economics Teacher, 12th Grade Advisor, Head of NHS</em></p><p><br></p><p>For those of you who do not know her, Ms. D’Agostino manages to have two completely different reputations depending on the students talking about her. Every year, the seniors will describe her as “chill”, while the juniors describe her as very strict. Don’t worry, though, if you are a junior, because as many a senior has told the juniors, she will warm up to you younglings. It is best not to be late to Ms. D’Agostino’s class as she very much does not like it, but if she’s late, remember to make sure you get that extra point she promises. If you ask her whether a quiz is graded, her response will always be, “Do I have an incentive to say no?”, so just assume they’re graded. Despite the fact that she claims the opposite, Ms. D’Agostino will give anecdotes about one of her sons much more than her other children. She has also been known to have an obsession with microwaving various foods. Through it all, Ms. D’Agostino is a lovely teacher and person who is always happy to discuss economics with you and her class will make you understand more about the real world.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>P.S. Buying the Ultimate Review Packet and getting all the videos from Mr. Clifford’s ACDC Econ is highly recommended to pass IB Economics, especially if you are taking the AP in Higher Level.</p><p><br></p><p>P.P.S. This class will give you what Mr. Clifford calls econ herpes, where you and your friends will make weird econ jokes that sometimes even make you cringe, but, despite the difficulty of this course, fear not as you will do well if you work hard and do not become a discouraged worker.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Mvr. Demyttenaere</strong></p><p><em>Roles in the School: Dutch teacher and Supervisor of Maitland Cottage Home</em></p><p><br></p><p>Mrs D is a very open teacher and person who loves discussing current events as well as personal stories with her students (as long as it’s in Dutch). Her class is great fun, and though her lessons may not always be very structured, they are always interesting. If you have her, you must convince her to go on a field trip to Amsterdam!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Mr. Diedrich</strong></p><p><em>Roles in the School: Philosophy Teacher, Speech and Debate Teacher, TOK Teacher, Debate Club Supervisor</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mr. Diedrich is one of the funniest and kindest teachers you will come across in your time at St John’s. His approach to philosophy makes it one of the most enjoyable classes, full of laughter, wonder, and questioning. You might wind up with one or two existential crises per week as a side-effect, but Mr. Diedrich’s life stories definitely make up for it. Ask him about the time he killed a cow, an infamous Alaskan ice-cream, polar bears, or Scottish sheep if you want a good laugh. Philosophy will just boost your mood for the day, and Mr. Diedrich’s interactive style of teaching makes philosophy an empowering and enriching class which will allow you to question the world around you, what you can and cannot see, who you are as a human (what does it mean to be human?). Most importantly, Mr. Diedrich will never make your opinion or comment seem unworthy, so all (constructive) ideas you might have on the material being taught are almost always welcome. Philosophy, after all, is about building your own opinion on philosophical matters amongst Mr. Diedrich’s jokes, anecdotes, and varied philosophers – and being able to build a case for it. He also teaches speech and debate as well as TOK. Speech and debate is a straightforward class where you will learn public speaking skills (of course his sense of humor carries over to all his classes), while TOK is basically a slightly different version of Philosophy.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Dr. Doyle&nbsp;</strong></p><p><em>Roles In The School: IB ESS Teacher, IB Biology Teacher, 9th and 10th Grade Biology Teacher, Chemistry Teacher, IB Core Teacher, Head of Gay-Straight Alliance, and 9th Grade Level Leader</em></p><p><br></p><p>Dr Doyle isn’t your typical science teacher. She’s a snack-giving, clog-wearing and life-guiding ESS, Biology and Chemistry teacher. In class, expect to learn more than what your course asks you to; you’ll meditate and find yourself in profound existential discussions - see this classroom as your second philosophy nook. But of course, don’t take this for granted, for her courses are still incredibly interesting and challenging.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Ms. Franzen&nbsp;</strong></p><p><em>Roles in the School: Business Management teacher and DP coordinator</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While Ms. Franzen seems strict at first, once you get to know her, you’ll realize what an amazing teacher she is. It is not possible to get lost or not know what’s going on in her class (unless you really aren’t listening to anything) for she’s one of the most organized teachers out there. The business class really appreciates her for it, as everything is very clear and she manages time well. On top of this great quality, she has an unique teaching style, and often uses games in class as a learning method. If you’re a slow writer you might be in trouble, but don’t worry, after a year of being in her class you’ll know how to keep up with her citing really well.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Madame Froidcoeur&nbsp;</strong></p><p><em>Roles: Geography Teacher, Yoga Teacher, CAS Advisor, and Social Studies Teacher</em></p><p><br></p><p>Class with Madame Froidcoeur is always something to look forward to. Learning and discussing interesting new topics while sipping on tea… yes please! Madame Froidcoeur is always in a bright mood and happy to discuss what we did on our holidays or something that’s happened during the day. She’s always looking for ways for us to enjoy the class, and makes sure to take into account our opinions in class decisions. If you’re looking for a way to relax after that long double period or geography test, every now and then she even offers yoga classes. Oh and by the way, If you’re looking to do well in geography class, just make sure you organize her packets well, use your geography textbook and of course listen up in class!</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Ms. Gingell</strong></p><p>Ms. Gingell is in charge of many things, including sports and part of the counselling department. She is always a nice, smiling face on C-level.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Ms. Glaser</strong></p><p><em>Note: Ms. Glaser will not be in school for the first semester of the 2018-2019 school year</em></p><p><em>Roles in the School: Dance Teacher</em></p><p><br></p><p>Ms. Glaser is a very talented dancer and teaches very many classes. Many students have marveled at her extravagant outfits and the height of her heels. She is good with students of all ages as she teaches many age groups and is also good at choreographing dances of different genres. Her dance studio is located in the PAC. Ms. Glaser not only teaches during school hours but also teaches many classes after school as well. She brings a selected group of dancers from St. John’s to a yearly “Dance ISSTs,” to perform with and for other schools in Europe, an unforgettable opportunity (despite last year’s struggles with weather.) Ms. Glaser is also in charge of our School Wide Dance Showcase which is absolutely amazing every year.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Señora Gortari&nbsp;</strong></p><p><em>Roles in the School: Spanish Teacher and 9th Grade Advisor</em></p><p><br></p><p>Mrs. Gortari is one of the sweetest teachers at St. John’s. She’s excellent at her job and is always there to help you if you’re struggling in her class. The workload isn’t too high and therefore, as long as you do your homework and your handwriting is legible, you’re sure to be on her good side. In fact, we’re not even sure she has a bad side. She has some great stories to tell, and is usually willing to go off on tangents about them, with a little persuasion. Overall, she’s a great teacher who’s very understanding and easy to talk to, just don’t ask her how to pronounce “leisure” in English.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Mr. Graham</strong></p><p><em>Roles in the school: Theater Teacher, Musical and Play Director, 11th Grade Advisor</em></p><p><br></p><p>With Mr. Graham, as long as you treat him with respect, he will be a fun and hilarious teacher to have. Theater lends itself to being a class where you can really get to know the other students and having such an engaged teacher is an important part of that. Mr. Graham is, to those in the IB with him, more than just a teacher. He is also our therapist, and to some, a role model and a friend. He is famous for his backflips on London tubes, world-class roasts of students who cross the line, and for always reminding us of the times when he was, “an actor/singer/dancer on Broadway and the West End”. If you ever go on a trip with him, expect many selfies and videos to look back on, as well as many inside jokes.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>P.S. Even though you’ve probably all heard it before, the key to passing theater with a good grade is doing those reflections. No one is a very big fan of them, but they just have to get done.</p><p><br></p><p>P.P.S. If you’re in IB Theater, don’t leave your big assignments to the last minute. We’ve all tried and regretted it.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Dr. Hausdorff&nbsp;</strong></p><p><em>Roles in the School: University Guidance and Academic Counselor</em></p><p><br></p><p>Dr. Hausdorff is an all-round wonderful person who is always happy to help you with any questions about courses and academic planning, especially in light of university. As we all know, colleges and applications can be very stressful, but Dr. Hausdorff is here to help us through it. No matter what is on your mind, you can go to her as she will be understanding and helpful, always making sure you get an answer.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Mr. Hennelly</strong></p><p><em>Roles in the School: Athletic Director</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mr. Hennelly is from London and with both an Irish and British passport, he calls himself a true 'plastic Paddy!' Not much is yet known about him except that his accent will be very different from Coach D’s. He has many qualifications in both coaching and leadership. He has even worked with some professional sports teams in the UK and Thailand.</p><p>He played in the world record attempt for the longest game of 5 a side football (46.5hrs) with some friends, SUP'd (stand up paddle-board) the Gota Canal in Sweden (over 200Km), and spent a year travelling around the world in 2014/15. It is clear that he is a man with many interesting stories to share.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Coach Jacobs&nbsp;</strong></p><p><em>Roles in the School: Sports, Exercise, and Health Science Teacher; Health Teacher; High School PE Teacher</em></p><p><br></p><p>Coach Jacobs, also known simply as Coach, is the Sports Exercise and Health Science teacher for IB students as well as being a health and PE teacher in high school. Coach is a friendly and a super outgoing teacher, willing to provide you with the best information possible. He also makes class entertaining through his teaching style because it is not that of the norm where one teacher hands out packets of notes and asks you to learn them. Rather, he explains everything in detail and attempts to engage his students by asking them to participate in class. Walking into his class is different than others because it has a homey feel to it. He is very good at making you feel comfortable due to his naturally calm state. In addition to his calmness, Coach is also a very understanding teacher who will accept valid reasons as to why a student hasn’t done work or anything related to school. Although, like every teacher, he does expect a certain amount of respect in his class and discipline which is important when learning new things.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Mr. Jones&nbsp;</strong></p><p><em>Roles in the School: English Teacher, Oxford Interview Preparation, and 12th Grade Advisor</em></p><p><br></p><p>Mr Jones, Jonesy for the elder ones, JJ for the younger ones, punctuates his classes with barely audible, highly sarcastic comments regarding the performance of his students. His class proves that he enjoys the laughter but possesses the needed seriousness for the present situations. Do not worry about learning new words, you will learn quite a number. Furthermore if you are on time for class, you will be awarded with some good reading. Late for class? You will be awarded with Tanizakian terms explaining you how you should conduct yourself in life. To be totally honest, in Mr Jones’ class, you don’t read books- you become the books. And finally, just keep one thought in your mind as you enter the classroom...There’s reading and there’s reading!</p><p><br></p><p>While all these words are well and good, the only way to stay true to Mr. Jones would be to do away with all of them and simply make his paragraph, “Mr. Jones is…” - in the style of Zuihitsu (follow the brush), follow your own path to discover the kind of teacher JJ is. Ma shows us that emptiness is full of potential, so it is the absence of words that creates the meaning, much like the empty space in a pot or a student’s empty brain at the beginning of the school year.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Madame Lariviere</strong> is a math teacher. Math never had a more enthusiastic fan than Madame Lariviere. If you ever have a complicated math problem to solve (you might even get a Gili-gili noise) or really just want to see the kind of excitement math can bring to someone, stop by and talk to her. Make sure you adapt to a fast-paced speaking speed before you start her class. Also, if you wish to speak to her, in person is recommended, as she does not often answer emails when it is not during school hours. Madame Lariviere runs most, if not all, of our math competitions (there are always math problems to solve outside her door, or speak to her personally for more specific competition opportunities.) P.S. We can attest to the fact that the reward for participating in these is sometimes pizza.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Mr. MacDonald</strong></p><p><em>Roles in the School: History Teacher, 12th Grade Advisor, In the Groove Supervisor</em></p><p><br></p><p>Mr. Macdonald is one of the more idiosyncratic characters at our school. He can be roused into dramatic speeches on the subject of travelling, family members, technology, and the power of books, with only a simple question or comment. A lover of darts and music, he is the coach of the varsity darts team, and key coordinator for the Vinyl Club, “In the Groove.” On a side note, Mr. Macdonald teaches history to the upperclassmen, with a captivating, perhaps unorthodox, style of teaching. The man goes the extra mile when teaching, like imitating the sound of a Junkers Ju 87, instead of just telling you about it. Always up for a chat, and having countless crazy stories of his life to share, Mr. Macdonald leaves a very obvious gap each Wednesday, when he takes the day off to take care of his children.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ms. Malinab</strong></p><p><em>Roles in the School: Math Teacher and Boarding House Supervisor</em></p><p><br></p><p>Ms. Malinab is a sweet and funny teacher who is great to be around if you are on her good side. To survive her class, absolutely do not get on her bad side. Also, don’t talk too much. Lastly, do not disrespect her personal space. Just don't. Also, she has two adorable twin babies.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Martine</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p>Martine is the high school secretary and resident dress coder. For her sanity, please try to follow page 10 of your agenda to the best of your abilities. Running back to your PE locker to change when you see her in the cafeteria is exhausting, so just come to school that way. We all know wearing shorts is tempting during the few weeks that Belgium actually becomes horribly hot, but it is not fair to Martine who would really rather not have to tell us to change. Martine's office is also where you go if you are leaving school early, need to get or hand in an assignment sheet (forms you need to fill in if you are missing school,) or if you're late to school.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Mr. Mitchell&nbsp;</strong></p><p><em>Roles in the School: Art Teacher, Supervisor of Art Club and Greene Gallery</em></p><p><br></p><p>Mr. Mitchell is a man full of passion and love for his job as a visual arts teacher. He deeply cares about his students and their progress, and is incredibly talented himself. Don’t get fooled by the very calm and sometimes, sleep-inducing voice, because behind that rests more knowledge than you could ever imagine, just yearning to be shared with the world. You might start off talking about an abstract painting, but you’ll end up discussing how we’re living in a social media and technology obsessed world. Or anything else ranging from history, philosophy, science, anthropology, politics, and of course, art. Just be prepared; if you’re coming in for a 5 minute chat, it means a 1 hour deep discussion, but you will come out of it enlightened.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ms. Morrell</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Roles in the School: Visual and Performing Arts Director</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ms. Morrell is our new Visual and Performing Arts Director. She is originally from Wales, but currently lives on a beautiful, remote island off of South Korea called Jeju. She plays both the violin (professionally) and now the viola, as well as having many types of music experience. She is excited to move to Belgium and looking to learn new languages (speak to her in French or Dutch or German… just kidding, maybe give her a little time to learn them), as well as other new experiences such as new foods.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Mr. Prowse</strong></p><p><em>Roles in the School: English Teacher and Middle School Advisor</em></p><p><br></p><p>Also known as Prowsie (although not to his face), Mr. Prowse is an English teacher and EE supervisor. He has many talents in a wide range of areas: poetry, puns, memes, insightful philosophical comments, appearing out of nowhere and disappearing just as fast because he is a busy person, subtle ironies and a ton of movie suggestions for all tastes. If you have him as an EE supervisor, he may appear as an all-time chill person, but you might hear the words “library” and “EBSCO” quite a lot! As an English teacher, you can tell he truly loves his subject and tries his best to make ever class fascinating, although sometimes he is a little too fascinated when he pauses films you study in class every 30 seconds. In any case, Mr. Prowse is a very cool and one of a kind teacher!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ms. Purves</strong></p><p><em>Roles in the School: Head of School</em></p><p><br></p><p>Ms. Purves has a whole article written about her which will tell you anything you need to know and can be found here: http://lionstale.news/page51.html</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ms. Reitze&nbsp;</strong></p><p><em>Roles in the School: MHS English Language Acquisition Teacher and MYP English Literature Teacher</em></p><p><br></p><p>Ms. Reitze is a new teacher this year who enjoys both teaching and traveling. She has taught in Mexico, China, and Germany, and is excited that Belgium will be the next country on the list. She is originally from the United States and lived there for most of her life. She is happy she will have the opportunity to work with the STJ students.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Mr. van Rijn</strong></p><p><em>Roles in the School: Math Teacher, CAS Coordinator, Supervisor of GAIA, MUN, and Alsemberg Refugee Center</em></p><p><br></p><p>As bad as it sounds, if you have a maths class just before lunch with Mr. Van Rijn you might just be in luck - he shares a love of food with many students. Feel free to eat in his class too just be warned that if you are eating fries he does require a “fry tax” so he will take one of your fries. Other things he shares with students are his fashion sense, jeans and a pair of vans are often his clothes of choice. He isn’t afraid to join in on some student gossip about other teachers(or students.)&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Feel free to try and talk to him about his plants and prize greenhouse to get on his good side. And check your emails. And show up to class on time. And do your homework that he gives everyday. And pay attention in class. Other than that you’ve got to feel for him he really does try to make maths class interesting and relatable and will help you no matter what to do your best, it helps he’s a pretty cool guy once you get to know him.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>P.S He is also a CAS coordinator, and he will take matters into his own hands and email your parents so for your own sake stick to the deadlines.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Coach Rita&nbsp;</strong></p><p><em>Roles in the School: PE and Healthy Living Teacher</em></p><p><br></p><p>She has been known to teach us things from pancakes in volleyball to the specific footing that you need to have in order to shoot a handball correctly. She is not happy if any student is late or not in uniform, and if you're sick and at school but not participating in PE, you will have to make up the PE class at lunch. Don't try to get out of PE for other classes such as religion because 1) it doesn't work (this has been tested,) and 2) PE teachers expect their class to be just as important to you as your other classes.</p><p>Note: 7s in her class are almost as rare as unicorns, so treasure them if you get one.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Mr. Roy&nbsp;</strong></p><p><em>Roles in the School: MHS Learning Support Teacher and Middle School Math Teacher</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mr. Roy is from the US and grew up in New Jersey. He raised his 3 children in Seattle and has a summer cottage in Quebec built by his grandparents on a beautiful lake. He has taught many subjects in different places around the world such as Egypt and Norway. He also has many other interests such as photography, writing poetry, playing the guitar, traveling, and cooking.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Madame Ruscher&nbsp;</strong></p><p><em>Roles in the School: French Teacher, 11th Grade Advisor, AP French Coordinator, and Supervisor of the Giraffe Project</em></p><p><br></p><p>Madame Ruscher is a wonderful teacher who is at the same time sweet and fiery. If you annoy her or do not do your work, she will be there to subtly roast you. We advise that you do all your homework in this class, because if you do not bring it with you, she will not hesitate to give you supervised study. Her class is engaging and more fun than most language classes. While you may not appreciate her class all the time, once it’s over you will miss it and will be left liking french more than you thought you ever would (this is from reputable sources.) Be on the lookout for the once a year time where she will give you chocolate or cookies. All in all, most students who pay attention enjoy her class, which, while sometimes repetitive, will make you better at french.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Ms. Saugstrup</strong></p><p><em>Roles in the School: Learning Support</em></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p>Ms. Saugstrup is a lovely teacher who helps with learning support. She works one on one with students as well as small groups, making sure they stay organized, meet their deadlines, and in the process become all round better students.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Mme Standaert</strong></p><p><em>Roles in the School: French Teacher</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mme Standaert is probably one of the kindest, nicest and most understanding teachers you will ever come across. She is very flexible and will try everything she can in order to adapt the course to her class, making sure everyone (or most students) enjoy what they are learning and find it interesting. She will also regularly ask for feedback as to whether you are enjoying the book or enjoying the class.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She will make sure that everyone in the class “va bien” before each lesson and that you’ve had a good weekend on Mondays. For her sake please do not make the “niveau Standaert” joke – she heard it more than would be necessary with last year’s juniors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fun fact: she calls her students “Les enfants”, which might feel a bit odd at first, but you’ll get used to it.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Coach Thomas</strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;"><em>Roles in the School: Health Teacher, PE Teacher, Dofe International Award Coordinator, and Deputy Athletic Director</em></span></p><p><br></p><p>Unlike others that you might have encountered, this coach is highly competitive and will not stand down when challenged to any physical activity. His teacher instincts are still there, but beast mode is also triggered. Especially with ultimate frisbee. Don’t even try to cross his path. With his athletic skills, he might just break ya ankles. He will always try to make class enjoyable for all his students and will do his best to make them interested in anything he is teaching.</p><p><br></p><p>His outer shell is hard to crack, but once you do, a soft and youthful side to him is revealed. Simply ask him about his baby daughter Nina and all anger will be forgotten. You know what they say, once you go dad you never go back.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Toki</strong></p><p><em>Roles in the School: Lab Assistant and Preparation</em></p><p><br></p><p>Toki is the fan favorite of the science department. He is always there for us when we need him and many struggling IB students will forever be in debt to his greatness. He is the assistant to all teachers, although the IB 1 Bio trip showed that his true loyalties must lie with Ms. Vohra as they are a water-testing, bug inspecting, ph-finding master duo. He is always there if you need a pipette or simply want to see a friendly face around the labs.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>P.S. If you can speak french, please speak to him in french because he prefers it.</p><p>P.P.S. Toki’s version of your in class experiment will probably be the only one that works.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ms. Tuppeny</strong></p><p><em>Roles in the School: Chemistry Teacher</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ms Tuppeny is a very smiley chemistry teacher. She has the reputation of explaining in ten minutes what everyone struggled to understand for over a year – and rightly so! Chemistry, I promise you, will make sense. Her love for her subject and for little stories make her class a fascinating experience. She will gladly make connections between the course material and the outside world – so much so that you might spend a class discussing how to put horses on a plane (and how to get them out), why the sky is looking particularly red, or where that funny smell is coming from. As you might have understood, she does get easily carried away. Ask her about the models she has, her latest acquisition (spoiler: it’s a noisy dog toy she was very much anticipating and is very proud of), the magnets (and occasionally why they are in a chandelier shape above your head), the clown balls which you can throw during the class without her getting annoyed (if it helps you learn, she’s fine with it), her printing budget (or lack thereof), or the school’s ventilation system and the headaches associated with it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fun fact: don’t fake understanding what she just said – if you didn’t get it she’ll notice… and kindly and patiently explain again until you get it!</p><p>Fun fact: she does say “yes” quite a lot.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Mr. Vanderkelen&nbsp;</strong></p><p><em>Roles in the School: Principal and French Teacher</em></p><p><br></p><p>Mr. Vanderkelen (Mr. V) is always a smiling face in the hallway, whether it’s “Happy Monday!”, “Happy Tuesday!”, “Happy Wednesday!”, or “Happy *insert any other day of the week*!”. He will always make sure to say hi to students every single time he sees them in the hallway. He is always around to give advice, especially on TOK (due to his well-guarded secret that he was previously a TOK teacher.) Mr. V is a very involved principal who also subs for classes and teaches french. As long as you smile back in the hallway, you will very easily get along with him.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Ms. Vohra</strong></p><p><em>Roles in the School: Biology Teacher, 10th Grade Coordinator</em></p><p><br></p><p>Ms. Vohra is a sweet, lovely person who always tries to teach her students what they need to know, trying her best to never get frustrated with them. She uses many videos and online sites in her teaching and her higher level class is a big fan of Bioninja’s battle music behind its videos. You should always make sure to read the textbook chapter in full (even the yellow boxes) before every IB Bio test you take. What shines through Ms. Vohra’s teaching is that she does really love her subject and also has a great sense of style, especially shown through her hat on our IB 1 trip which we all loved. While almost all the experiments her IB 1 class last year tried to complete failed, hopefully you won’t.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p>P.S. Never expect a perfect score on a written assignment - they never happen.</p><p>P.P.S. She and Toki are a dynamic duo - See Toki’s paragraph for more details.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Willmott&nbsp;</strong></p><p><em>Roles in the School: German Teacher</em></p><p><br></p><p>Dr. Willmott, or Frau Willmott, if you will, teaches all the German classes in high school, from beginner to native. She is known to vanish and reappear in random places. However, you have nothing to fear from her unless you:</p><p>1. Are a millisecond late</p><p>2. Have not handed in your homework</p><p>But if you do well or at least try to, she will cut you some slack. If you plan on taking German, get a REALLY big binder; I am certain the number of worksheets, tests and review packages she hands out on paper equates to half a rainforest. But all in all, she is a great teacher and her teaching yields results.</p><p>P.S. If she ever promises to hand out candy/chocolate "if you're really good" be prepared to receive such candy/chocolate 1 out of 5 times it is talked about.</p><p>P.P.S. Do NOT try and speak another language to conceal what you're saying. She speaks almost every language.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Mrs. De Wolf&nbsp;</strong></p><p><em>Roles in the School: Community Liaison</em></p><p><br></p><p>Ms. De Wolf’s is a face you will often see around school and at all events. She will usually be busy taking photos, but will always be helpful when you need it, especially if you go visit her in her office in the PAC to ask questions. She is also the voice behind the St. John’s Facebook and Instagram.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Places On Campus</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The Sports Foyer</strong> is a social hub. On any given day, there will be a group or two eating lunch here. There are some very comfortable couches and a number of tables to eat at. I'm sure every high schooler has a cringy memory from a school dance here. After school, it always smells of popcorn because of the Booster Club food stand which is a great place to get a snack. This is also where all ISST breakfasts are held as well as various other events.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>The Gym </strong>is not only the location of after school practices, but also where a group of sweaty boys will be playing basketball every day at lunch. It also serves as a location for any number of random school events from international day to student council election speeches.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>The Cafeteria </strong>is another social place, both during break and lunch. It serves overpriced food, but sometimes has new inventions, such as the popular “Vegan Cordon Bleu" of parmesan risotto chips. About once a week, there will be a day where nothing seems appetizing, but always know that Thursday is chicken nugget day and Tuesday is Friesday (we know it should be Friday, but oh well, life is confusing.) Every grade has their own unspoken assigned table, but the groups that eat here vary. If you need a coffee, there is a machine which will allow you to buy coffee or tea with change at the front of the teachers' eating area.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>C-Level </strong>is a wonderful area to hang out during break, lunch, or free blocks. If you get there early, you might be lucky enough to see a stray student getting the sleep they should have gotten the night before. The pattern of the tables is ever-changing, so it's always a nice surprise to see what they look like on any given day. Many offices open up to C-level including the counselors' offices, the IB Coordinator's office, and the CAS Coordinator's office. It is also the location of Supervised Study after school, which is most often not a voluntary activity. Note: C-Level has great couches, interesting high tables near the window, and a printer.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>The PAC </strong>is the arts building where theater, music, dance, and visual arts are located. This is also the location of all performing arts classes and where all performing arts productions are shown. This building should only be used by those who have a class or activity there at that time. The previous senior lounge in the PAC is no more, but there are some tables in the back which you can sit at. The PAC is also the location of various events, including sports awards.</p><p><br></p><p>Note: This is also the location of the Lion’s Lair, where you can buy needed school supplies or STJ swag.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>The middle school foyer </strong>is filled with interesting places to sit. In the morning, no high schooler dares to sit here as it is always swarming with moodle schoolers. At other times of day, though, it can be a nice place to sit.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>The courtyard </strong>is where everyone goes to eat when there is even the slightest bit of sun. Other than this, it is also used for school events and, again, sweaty boys playing basketball anytime they get a chance.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>The field </strong>is the other popular location when the sun comes out. Many students eat lunch there or play soccer.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>The science hallway </strong>is also home to another couch and a printer. For some, this is their favorite part of the science wing. If going through the science wing to get to the cafeteria takes away your appetite, there is another entrance to the cafeteria here down the stairs.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>The D-Level hallway</strong> is used for last minute study sessions during finals, but is otherwise mostly populated by freshmen. It also is home to most social studies and language classes.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>The Library </strong>is often used to study before school, during break, during lunch, after school, or during free blocks. It is a godsend during finals if you need a quiet place to study, as there is a quiet room where no one is supposed to speak. People are rarely seen actually checking out books, but it must happen at some point. It is used for teacher meetings on Monday mornings, so don't go in there then. Note: No food is allowed in the library.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>The red seats on the grass outside the PAC </strong>are also underappreciated, but should definitely be used when the weather is nice.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>The library patio </strong>is used during free blocks when the weather is nice. Maybe student council can arrange for a barista to be hired to serve a coffee.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>The Boarding House </strong>is across the street from the school through the back gates. This is Saint John’s newest addition and we are all interested to see what it is like. Updates will come once a source can be found to inform us on what it is like.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Clubs</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Alsemberg Refugee Center </strong>allows students to go play with children at a refugee center. It is an extremely fulfilling experience where students color or play sports with young kids to brighten their lives.</p><p><strong>Meeting Time: </strong>One Sunday a Month</p><p><strong>Potential Sections of CAS: </strong>Service</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Amnesty International </strong>raises funds for a chosen cause.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Meeting Time: </strong>Monday Lunch&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Potential Sections of CAS: </strong>Creativity and Service</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Annai Erika Home </strong>is meant to help schools and orphanages in need.

We have yet to find out.</p><p><strong>Meeting Time:</strong> TBD</p><p><strong>Potential Sections of CAS: </strong>Creativity</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Choir </strong>is the only club where you will actually get a grade.

They will also perform at the School Wide Dance Showcase. Note: Those who participate in the Dance ISSTs will most likely get cool STJ Dance Swag like jackets or bags. Also, we are unsure of who will teach after school dance as Ms. Glaser will not be here for the first semester.</p><p><strong>Meeting Time: </strong>Wednesday After School 3:45-5:30 in the Dance Studio or the Drama Room, depending on the day</p><p><strong>Potential Sections of CAS: </strong>Creativity and Action</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Debate Club </strong>is a club where people learn to debate.

It’s basically more CAS, along with adventurous journeys (where you go hike, camp, and cook for yourselves.) You can start it in freshman or sophomore year and continue through until senior year. It’s definitely a Commitment.</p><p><strong>Meeting Time: </strong>Different lunchtimes for different levels, on C-Level</p><p><strong>Potential Sections of CAS: </strong>Creativity, Action, and Service</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Feminist Society </strong>is a group that has meetings to talk about issues related to the feminist movement. It is a pretty free discussion group, which usually has a theme for each meeting.</p><p><strong>Meeting Time: </strong>Wednesday Lunch</p><p><strong>Potential Sections of CAS: </strong>Creativity and Service</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>GAIA (Global Awareness, Investigation, and Action) </strong>is a club dedicated to all things related to the environment. It allows students to look into any environmental issue that they would like to. It also has a Gaia Garden and many plants in Mr. van Rijn’s room. The GAIA garden has definitely grown and now includes a greenhouse and an insect hotel. It’s a really fun time to go out with your friends and help our planet.</p><p><strong>Meeting Time: </strong>Wednesday Lunch in HB01</p><p><strong>Potential Sections of CAS: </strong>Creativity, Action, and Service</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Gay-Straight Alliance </strong>is a place where people can go to talk about LGBTQ+ issues and general questions.

For aspiring artists, this is a real opportunity to learn what running a gallery is like. There are many jobs in the club, ranging from interviewing people at exhibitions to putting up artwork to performing at the art shows.</p><p><strong>Meeting Time: </strong>Some mondays during the year in the Greene Gallery</p><p><strong>Potential Sections of CAS: </strong>Creativity and Service</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>In the Groove </strong>is a group that plays different records, listens to them, and appreciates them together.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Meeting Time: </strong>Thursday Lunch in HD03</p><p><strong>Potential Sections of CAS: </strong>Creativity</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Lion’s Tale </strong>is our online student newspaper, which allows articles to be written about pretty much anything, ranging from arts to comedy to anything you can think of.
