We were all a little bit older than the kids who were at school. One evening this one friend said, ‘let’s all go to the movies!’. I said okay. I get to the movie theatre, and she’s not there, but there are two other people that I recognize from class – this is before cell phones and all that. I think “okay, well, she’s not there.” But then we start talking, ‘Are you here to meet Isabelle?”, “Yes!”, “And you?”, “Yes!”. And so we ended up going into the movie – Isabelle never showed up. After the movie, we went to go look for our mutual friend, and we found out that she had had a fight with her boyfriend, and that’s why she hadn’t shown up. But we thought, “Hey, we’re having a good time, let’s all go out.” So we all went to a bar, and I started talking to these two people, a girl and a guy. Immediately, I thought, “This guy’s really nice, I really like this guy!” He had grown up in the states, he had this parallel story – similar culture, similar things. And as the evening was progressing, I was meeting his brothers, because he’s got 5 brothers, so they kept coming into the bar. And I was like “woah, what a crazy family.” Later on, I thought, “Hm I really, really like this guy.” A few days later, I get home, and my mom says, “This guy Laurent called for you.” I’m like, “Laurent? Are you sure it was Laurent?” – because it was the brother that called for me! I didn’t call him back. Eventually, my husband and I started going out, even though the first one that called to ask me out was another one of the brothers.</p><p><br></p><p> 
</p><p>
</p><p>And the fun story is that the other girl that was with us at the movie theatre, ended up being Zoe’s godmother. The two people that I met, perchance, at that movie theatre, ended up being very important people in my life!”

I was choreographing a piece that had a number of couples in it, and I needed male dancers. He was taking a dance class for PE credit. He volunteered to do the dance. At the time, I was a sophomore and he was a junior. We were friendly but weren’t dating; we ran in different circles. He was a scientist, spent a lot of time in the lab… and I was in the dance studio most of the time, or the English classroom. Our worlds crossed at college parties at political rallies. And so we were friends, but not particularly close friends in college. About 4 years after I graduated, I was living in New York city and working in a school. He was doing a PHD down at John Hopkins University and working in DC. Some friends and I were going on a ski trip, and we were inviting other people to come along. Then, one of our mutual friends said, “I’m going to invite Bill! You remember him! You guys are really going to hit it off!” – And we did. So, this group of about 8 or so of us went on the ski trip, and we spent the weekend having a good time together. Then, him being in Washington and me being in New York, we started talking on the phone in the evenings and seeing each other on the weekends. Eventually I moved to Washington, and there you go!”</p></div>
