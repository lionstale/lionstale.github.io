    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">As I am going to be attending McGill University, an institution that finds itself in Montr√©al, Canada, I have been asked to share my process and journey for applying to schools in Canada. Being a veteran of the admissions process, I am happy to disclose my experience and words of advice to anyone considering going to Canada to pursue their education.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><br></p><p>First off, it needs to be said that there are many benefits to attending university in Canada: the tuition is often lower for international students in comparison to what you may find in the US, Canada harbours a great deal of cultural diversity making it international student friendly, and there are many universities known worldwide for their high-quality education.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The process starts with a meeting with the advisor assigned to you to determine what you are looking for in a university. It is a good idea to narrow down what you like and dislike in a university in preparation for your consultation with your advisor. Doing so allows your advisor to be more helpful in guiding you through the process of selecting a school.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Something I learned while consulting with my advisor is that the application process to Canada is one of the most straightforward in the world when completing the IB. This is because Canadian universities rarely ask applicants to write essays or have a letter of recommendation, unlike schools in the US. The application to my four chosen schools (McGill University, University of Ottawa, Carleton University and York University) did not demand any essays or standardised test scores like the SAT or the ACT.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Instead, the schools simply wanted good grades. While this is a given, keeping up grades is incredibly important, especially since schools will often demand to see your transcript with your grades from semester 1 of 12th grade. This is because the university wants to see your most recent grades to gauge who you are as a student.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>While the IB is still relatively new in comparison to A levels and the AP system, it is becoming more recognised on an international scale. This became evident to me when I started doing some research into universities that fit my preferences. As it turns out, Canada understands the rigor of the IB so much so that often, the admissions requirements are relatively low. This, however, is completely dependent upon the course and faculty that you are applying to as the requirements for a bachelor in the arts are lower than those for a bachelor in engineering.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>This exceptional understanding of the IB puts those students who complete the diploma at a certain advantage, as the admissions requirements are quite attainable (my requirements ranged from 28 to 34 subject points).</p><p><br></p><p>Because Canada values diversity, universities are more inclined to grant scholarships to high achieving international students as an incentive to attend the school, and in hopes that they become Canadian citizens later in life. I was made aware of this fact when I was offered three scholarships to universities for being international and completing the IB diploma.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>To conclude, the benefits to applying to Canadian universities as an IB student are vast: the admissions requirements are attainable, there are no essays or test scores involved, and they are eager to grant international students scholarships. If I were to give advice to anyone who is about to start applying for college, it would be to work hard so that you put yourself in the best possible position to choose where you will pursue your extra education.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p></div>
