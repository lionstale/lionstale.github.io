    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p>Amazon, the American electronic commerce company, has faced much criticism from politicians, both for hurting traditional retailers and tolerating stressful workplace conditions. As the company has grown, a greater variety of products have become available on its website. It has pulled business away from other companies, and become much like a monopoly.  Competitors such as Sears and Toys-R-Us have been forced to close or lay off workers. Many politicians such as Rep. David Cicilline D-R.I. and Bernie Sanders have called for Amazon to be broken up.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>In addition, new legislation has been proposed to tax companies for every dollar their low-wage workers require in government health care benefits and food stamps, in order to encourage higher wages. In 2017, the median pay for Amazon employees was $28,500 a year, well below the median wage for all workers in America ($44,564 a year).&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Amazon has also been accused of giving insufficient vacation time, inadequate breaks during shifts, and other negative workplace conditions. There have been stories of employees peeing in bottles and trash cans as they are scared to take bathroom breaks due to strict deadlines. Many employees have gotten injured or suffered panic attacks, leading Amazon workers around the country to stage strikes.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>With Jeff Bezos, President and CEO of Amazon, now being the richest man in the world (his net worth is more than $165 billion), activists implored him to raise wages for workers. The pressure from US senator Bernie Sanders and labor organizers has compelled Amazon to raise its minimum wage for US employees to $15, effective next month. This would raise the annual wage for the lowest paid employees to $31,200 per year, an amount Bezos makes every nine seconds. Those already making $15 or more will also receive a pay increase. This wage raise will affect more than 250,000 American employees, including part-time and temporary employees, as well as 100,000 seasonal workers.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>This minimum wage raise will not only benefit Amazon through good publicity, but will also allow it to attract more workers in a tight labor market. Despite increased robotization and cashierless convenience stores called AmazonGo, Amazon still requires large numbers of workers.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>As the minimum wage raise is coming into effect before the holiday season, the wage raise may be necessary to attract the temporary workers Amazon requires, making Amazon seem like a better job option than its competitors. The wage raise may also stop Amazon workers working in Whole Foods’ stores around the country from unionizing. However, in conjunction with this minimum wage raise came a reduction of benefits. For example, warehouse workers will no longer receive stock in the company or get bonuses.</p><p><br></p><p>After raising its minimum wage, Amazon pledged to advocate for raising the federal minimum wage, which has been $7.25 for about a decade. While this seems like an admirable goal, many economists believe it is simply being done to force its competitors to pay higher wages so that their costs rise as well.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Amazon’s rivals, Walmart and Target, have made similar minimum wage pledges following Amazon’s announcement. This rise in minimum wages may be too good to be true, as average wage is already rising slowly as a result of the labor market being near full employment. This makes Amazon raising the minimum wage seem like it is simply following the pattern formed by changing labor market conditions. But a company as large as Amazon raising wages makes a statement. This may lead to a trend of companies following Amazon’s example, in the hopes of remaining competitive.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Overall, Amazon raising its minimum wage has been a matter of great controversy, spurred by a combination of labor market and political pressures. Whether the new $15 minimum wage is large enough increase to outweigh the reduction in benefits implemented is still up for debate. The hope is that Amazon will continue to work to improve its workplace conditions. Nevertheless, it is still possible that the company only raised its minimum wage for its own self-interest.&nbsp;</p></div>
