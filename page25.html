    <div class="container">

            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p>On Thursday afternoon, after we’d all settled into the comfortable boredom and inattentiveness that comes with every school assembly, some of our peers presented their clubs and trips, all of which contain necessary criteria for those of us who wish to graduate: Creativity, Activity, and Service. This was done in a variety of ways and provided us with a lot of information. So, for any of you who forgot or missed anything, below you’ll find all the information you’ll need.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Firstly, for all you overachievers out there, STUCO is an excellent opportunity to put in your two cents and try and make the school a better place. STUCO is “An opportunity for everyone to have a voice” according to Junior, the Co-President. They meet Monday at lunchtime in HC12. If you have any STUCO related questions, you can e-mail Junior at tabuanahagi@stjohns.be. Next we have NHS, however, unlike other clubs, the National Honors Society is by recruitment only. The Lion's Tale is the student school publication and in my unbiased opinion the best club out there. They meet Thursday at lunch in room HD06.</p><p><br></p><p>Debate club will be meeting Tuesday at lunch in room HB08. This year they will be balancing fun debates and more serious debates on current events. As an unfortunate surprise for argumentative party-organizers, Tuesday at lunch is also the Prom Committee, meeting in Ms. Larsons room. After a stunning performance, the High School dance club was “very happy so many people were signing up”, a quote from club member Kajsa. Dance will be meeting from 3:35-5:30 in Mr. Graham’s Room or the Dance Studio if no one is there. The Giraffe Project is a charity that provides sponsorship and support for the education of  kids living in Kenya. They will be meeting Monday at break in Mme. Ruschers room.</p></div>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p>GAIA, or Global Awareness Investigation and Action, is a club that focuses on environmental issues and places emphasis on acting on them.  They will be meeting Wednesday at lunch in HB01. Varsity Darts is on Tuesday at lunch in Mr. MacDonalds room, HD03. Amnesty International is an independent group from any political party or religious organization. They actively pursue justice wherever there seems to be a lack of it to fight power abuses worldwide. This group is run by Megan and Junior and will be meeting Wednesdays at lunch in room HC17. Jazz Band will be meeting Wednesday at lunch, Choir will be meeting Wednesday at 4:00-5:30, and Vocal Jazz will be meeting Thursday at lunch, all in the PAC. All of these are excellent opportunities to become a better artist and have no conflicting sports.</p><p><br></p><p>MUN will be meeting Tuesday at lunch in room HB01 to debate and discuss global issues. No prior knowledge is necessary but one should have a decent understanding of global issues and politics before joining the Model United Nations. The Feminist Society will be meeting Thursdays at lunch in room HB08 to discuss issues concerning feminism and equality. They would also like us to know that they are not anti-men. The programming club will be meeting Friday at lunch in Dr. Carlin’s room. Remember to bring your laptop! The chess club was a bit too busy playing chess to answer my questions, but I did manage to get the important stuff out of them. They’ll be meeting Friday at lunch in Mme. Larivieres room.</p></div>
