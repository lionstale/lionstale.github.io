            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p>Starting the IB diploma program comes with a few well-known warnings: you might not get as much sleep, you need to keep doing your CAS, and you need to work <em>hard</em>. However, as January comes to a close and deadlines are passing all of us by, I realise that what I struggle with – and what I see all of my peers struggle with – is not on the list I have just mentioned. Before I continue, it’s important to note that most of us are in the middle of those hectic months of deadlines and submissions and absolute craziness – but somehow all of that pressure is just one of the many things we have on our backs.
</p><p><br></p><p>We’re unsure. Anybody who tells you they aren’t is probably lying to either you or themselves. After nearly 18 years of saying what we wanted to be, we’re faced with an even more horrifying prospect – the fact that <em>we might actually have to be what we want to be</em>. To most people this sounds like a dream; I knew what I wanted to be, or at least what I wanted to study, ever since I was in primary school. The problem is that the stress isn’t about deciding what we want to do (although this is also pressure – inducing and problematic in its own right) but it’s the realisation <em>we actually have to do it</em>. Every dream you have ever had is suddenly becoming an option. It’s been months and already I see people second-guessing themselves every day because during this year nothing is certain anymore! Do we want to be who we said we wanted to be yesterday? Will we want to be that person a year from now? We find ourselves looking for safety nets, ‘get out of jail free cards’ from any sort of major life planning that could be avoided. This pressure, this constant fear of having to make decisions for and by yourself, creates an unnerving and insecure atmosphere that transfers itself across to all disciplines of our lives. I sent a final IB assessment to Mr. Graham one day and then resent the same email with a modified attachment entitled “FINAL FINAL FINAL Version” – this, I’m sure, is a scenario relatable to all IB students.</p></div>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p>This is the type of pressure that unfortunately makes or breaks our relationships. When undergoing these sorts of emotions, you either find solace in your friends or rival them – do they know what they’re doing? How are they so together? Why can’t I be more like that? It’s times like these it can be admittedly hard trying to remember that we need to look out for people other than ourselves.</p><p><br></p><p>
</p><p>On top of these emotions, the stress of extracurriculars can get to you too. We do extracurriculars because we love them and they’re our passions – either that or we have a CAS requirement. I like to <em>think</em> we do them because we love them. But when you’re running on minimum sleep, you know you have basketball practice until late, college apps (yes, the ones you haven’t finished yet) are due in two days and the <em>tiniest thing goes wrong</em>? Disaster. It’s awful. It feels as if that one thing that went wrong that you were counting on to go right was a foreshadowing of your whole day/week/month/life.
</p><p><br></p><p>That being said, January does bring a certain hope to fruition. I can look back and safely say that November was the most stress inducing month for me (until May, presumably). I remember getting in the car after a long day of school late November, knowing that I had a mountain of work to do when I got home, and hearing my Mum tell me that we were going out to dinner as a surprise. Tears weren’t the result, but they were pretty damn close.
</p><p><br></p><p>You’re probably wondering, “But that’s a good thing! A dinner out is a lovely surprise for a stressed student!” and to that I would agree with you. However, this is merely an extension of my previous point. When your time is being stretched thinner than is visible to the eye, the slightest changes in scheduling can be the straw that breaks your back. This is what has become extremely apparent to me watching my peers.
</p><p>So, if I have any advice to you future IB students, it would just be to give everyone a break. People will be snappy, moody and rude at times and you just have to accept it. You’ll all be cranky and you’ll all be tired, but most importantly, you’ll all be going through the same thing.
