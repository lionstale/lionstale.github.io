Conrad’s agent, Albert Peterson, told the press last week that Conrad came from West Virginia where he was the son of wealthy planters and sang under the plantation moon. Albert’s secretary, on the other hand, told the press that she found Conrad singing at a waterfront saloon in Hong Kong. These stories are way too different to both be true. A reporter at The Lion’s Tale tells all about the actual story of Conrad Birdie.</p></div>

            <div class="col-xs-12 lead">This week, newly released formerly confidential federal government documents revealed the true story that the government didn’t really mean to draft Conrad Birdie into the army, as the loss of such a great public figure would lower American morale, but due to a clerical error they drafted him instead of his hillbilly twin brother Billy-Bob Birdie. ‘How would Conrad Birdie have a twin brother who was so much unlike him?’ you may ask. The records show that Conrad Birdie was actually the son of poor farmers in Mississippi, which is apparently known for being the “Hillbillyest State in America.” Here’s his story:<div><br></div><div>Conrad was actually born as Connie Birdie, which made him the butt of many jokes in the fourth grade. He was also a chubby fourth grader, so he picked up the nickname Connie Fats, which he hated, but didn’t turn him off his Twinkie habit. After getting fed up with his bullies, he changed his name to Conrad, which he thought was more manly. He then spent his whole life trying to prove to people that he was as manly as his new name. From the fourth grade onwards, he rebelled in any way he could. At 13, he started drinking a new brand of Moonshine called Sincere, which was the true inspiration for his “Honestly Sincere.” The entire thing was inspired by a night of drinking too sincerely causing walking tree hallucinations that led him to crash his father’s tractor into one. When he thinks about a tree, he really does feel that tree.</div><div><br></div><div>Conrad always thought his personality was too big for the small town of Middleburg, Mississippi, so when his father kicked him out for ruining their livelihood when he crashed that tractor, Conrad stowed away on a train to New York. When he got there, he lived on the streets begging for money in the only suit he owned, a bright, shiny, velvet, pink suit (which inspired his velvet blue suit on Ed Sullivan years later) which his mother bought him for Christmas once as a joke. That pink suit was the only thing his father let him take when he kicked him out as further punishment.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>When Conrad saw that street singers actually drew crowds and money, he took a shot at it. He even briefly had a double act with a certain amateur tap dancer named Gloria Rasputin. After the double act failed, he was picked up by a beer company who sponsored him to advertise their drink through song. This led Conrad to have his first crush: beer.&nbsp;</div></div>

            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p>Conrad met Mae at her unsuccessful attempt to ween herself off the bottle at AA (Alcoholics Anonymous,) after her dog Lou died. After a single meeting, Conrad and Mae ended up at a karaoke bar, where Mae heard him sing and drunkenly promised to make Conrad famous as a singer, writing up a contract which they both signed right there and then (hopefully for Mae, not only are her drunk words sober thought but her drunk actions sober actions.) This was also the night where Mae’s constantly suppressed love for Conrad began.</p><p><br></p><p>Mae begged Albert to help her meet her contract goals of making this drunk famous and this was how Almaelou began. Thanks to his love of beer, Conrad finally managed to achieve his dreams of making the country see that he was worth more than the tractor he crashed and proved his dad wrong.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>After becoming famous, he actually met a childhood friend who had come to New York. He fell in love with her and reminisced about their days playing in hay bales by drinking Sincere together. He remembered that he gave her a licorice ring as a friendship ring at the age of 8, and said he would replace it with a diamond ring which he actually bought her. While he thought they were engaged, she apparently thought the ring was actually a friendship ring, so poor Connie Birdie was permanently in the friend zone, having never been pinned by the ripe old age of 17. From then on, he was always attached to one of his two favorite things: his leopard-print bathrobe or his flask. We can now ask ourselves if celebrities are truly better off, or if Connie Birdie might have been happier staying at home with Maw and Paw, Billy-Bob, and his thirteen other siblings.</p><p><br></p></div>
