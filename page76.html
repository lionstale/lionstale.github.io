I was on an exchange and she was doing Erasmus, and my immediate impression was, “wow, when that girl is embarrassed, she really blushes.” And yeah, we were studying together. I was otherwise attached at the time, but that didn’t prevent us – my now-wife and I – having some interactions. She had friends over for cups of tea at her place that she was sharing with other University students. A couple of times, when she had these tea parties, no one else hung around to help clean up the dishes, so I did, and we got to know each other and that was nice. We even played a game of tennis one time. And then I went back to Australia and really that was all the contact we had. And I left thinking she was a really nice girl. I came home and my other attachment – that relationship – it wrapped up. I got the nerve to get back in touch with my now-wife 18 months later. Fortunately, I hadn’t lost the note paper with her email written on it, and even more fortunately she hadn’t changed email addresses. We’ve talked at length about how important that little piece of paper has been to our intervening years. I eventually came over to visit under the pretense of “meeting other friends in Europe,” but really just to spend time with her. She later came out to Australia, and then I moved over here, and we got married soon after. 
</p><p>I’ve glossed over some of the more shameful parts. Perhaps I ought to have gotten in touch with her a long time earlier – I just couldn’t bring myself to imagine that that kind of girl would sustain a long-distance relationship with a bloke like me. But eventually I mustered the courage and I’m terribly glad I did. I thank my lucky stars every day that she was silly enough to say yes.”

She would organize drinks in different cafés in Leuven. I also had another friend – John – from Ireland. He also had a good number of friends, and organized drinks in cafés from time to time. One day, Morena was invited to drinks by one of John’s friends, and I was invited by John. Morena brought along another friend of hers whose name was Veronique. We all got together, a huge group, probably about 20 people, in the café called Todos in Leuven which produced many different kinds of beer. Anyway, it was there, having a drink with this diverse group of people, where I met my wife for the first time. I remember we were having a big discussion – in those days people always had discussions about issues present in the international student community or in the city. The funny part of the conversation was that everybody was speaking their own language – Flemish, Portuguese, French, Italian – it was always a mixture of languages. The topic at that moment was integration, and whether international students should integrate and to what extent – and in that broad discussion, I had an exchange of ideas with Veronique. She was Flemish, defending her culture, and I was international, defending my community. And ever since, here we are. We’ve already been together for 18 years.”</p></div>

I was doing an internship with the gas and oil company, Shell, and my wife was doing a semester abroad. We met through Michele’s college buddy because I wanted to get a scholarship at the university Michele was going to. That weekend, we chatted each other up at a birthday party and continued the night at a dance club. That’s sort of the gist of it. We traveled together for 6 weeks through Europe. She went back to California; I went back to the Netherlands, but we wrote every day. We traveled together across the United States, as well. The rest is history. We’re obviously from two different continents, and just happened to be in the same place at the same time. It wasn’t until two years after we met that we got married. We’ve been married for 30 years. Most of your parents are newlyweds compared to us.”</p></div>
